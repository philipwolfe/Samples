<h4>Welcome to the Microsoft .Net Framework SDK QuickStart Tutorials</h4>

The QuickStart Tutorials are the fastest way to understand what the .Net Framework technology offers leading-edge developers.  
Inside you'll find information about the most compelling features of the .Net Framework technology, including how to put them immediately to work for you or your company. 
To get started, follow the links below.

<div class="indent">

<p><span class="caption">The ASP.NET QuickStart</span><br> ASP.NET is a rich 
programming framework for building web-based applications.  It offers 
outstanding support for both developers and administrators, providing 
improved ease-of-use, tool support, reliability, scalability, 
administration and security.  The ASP.NET QuickStart walks through a series 
of sample code and concepts to teach you how to make the most of this 
powerful technology.  

<div class="buffer-top"><a target="_top" href="../aspplus/default.htm">[ Start the ASP.NET QuickStart Tutorial ]</a></div>

<p><span class="caption">The Windows Forms QuickStart</span><br> Windows Forms is 
a rich programming framework for building Win32 client applications.  It 
offers great support for Win32 developers, providing improved ease-of-use, 
superb tool support, rock solid reliability, much lower deployment costs 
and associated reductions in total cost of ownership.  The Windows Forms 
QuickStart walks through a series of sample code and concepts to teach you 
how to make the most of this powerful technology.  

<div class="buffer-top"><a target="_top" href="../winforms/default.htm">[ Start the Windows Forms QuickStart Tutorial ]</a></div>

<p><span class="caption">How Do I...?</span><br> The How Do I?  section 
demonstrates some of the more common tasks that developers need to 
accomplish, such as reading and parsing XML, performing data access, and 
accessing services like Active Directory or Win32 APIs.

</div>

<h5>Printing the QuickStart Topics</h5>

To print the QuickStart topics, set your browser to print in "Landscape" mode, then right-click the topic body and choose "Print".

<h5>Hosting the QuickStart Tutorials on a Remote Server</h5>

Since many of the samples are Windows Forms or console based, these tutorials are best experienced when installed to your
local machine.  However, if you wish to host these samples from a server, you may do so by making the following 
configuration settings in the <b>config.web</b> file at the /quickstart root directory:
<p>
<div class="code"><pre>
&lt;appsettings&gt;
    &lt;add key="RemoteHost" value="true" /&gt;
&lt;/appsettings&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
This has the effect of downgrading samples which cannot be run from the Web to "View Source" only.
<p>
You will also need to edit the security settings for each virtual directory in the quickstart to grant access to 
machines other than "localhost" (the local machine).  To do this:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Start the Internet Services Manager by choosing Start->Run and typing "inetmgr".
<li>Expand the "Default Web Site" item in the left-side tree.
<li>Right-click the "quickstart" virtual directory, and choose "Properties".
<li>Select the "Directory Security" tab and edit the "IP address and domain name restrictions."
<li>Add the machines you wish to grant access, or grant access to all machines.
</ul>

<b>Note:</b>  By granting access to remote machines you may be compromising the security of your web server.  While every precaution
has been taken to prevent malicious use of the .NET Framework in this release, the product is a Beta pre-release and cannot be
considered "risk-free".
