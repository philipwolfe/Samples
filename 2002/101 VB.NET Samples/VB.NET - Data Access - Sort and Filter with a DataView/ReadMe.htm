		<h1>Data Access:  Sort and Filter with a Dataview</h1>
		<P>
			This sample shows some how to use a dataview to sort and filter the contents of 
			a table of product information.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<h2>Featured Highlights:</h2>
		<P>The code demonstrates how to use a dataview to sort and filter the contents of 
			the products table from the Northwind SQL Server database. When the main form 
			loads, the products table is retrived into a dataset using a simple&nbsp;SQL 
			Select statement.&nbsp;A dataview is constructed to filter and sort the 
			products table. The user can&nbsp;select filter and sort criteria and view the 
			results in a datagrid, without having to return to the data source. Rows may be 
			filtered by selecting those products that have a user selected first character, 
			for example all product names that begin with C, or by the UnitsInStock column, 
			for example all rows that have &gt; 10 units. The rows displayed may also be 
			sorted on a primary/secondary sort key, each sort key allowing ascending or 
			descending ordering. The primary sort key is the UnitsInStock column&nbsp;and 
			the secondary key is UnitsOnOrder column.</P>
		<h2>Requirements:</h2>
			Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or greater).
        <br>
        <br>
				Access to the Northwind database residing in SQL Server or the Microsoft Data 
				Engine (MSDE).&nbsp; To install MSDE, do the following:
				<UL>
					<LI>
						<DIV align="left">Open the Start menu, then click Programs, the click Microsoft 
							.NET Framework SDK, and then click Samples and Quickstart Tutorials.
						</DIV>
					<LI>
						<DIV align="left">Click "Step 1: Install the .NET Framework Samples Database".</DIV>
					<LI>
						<DIV align="left">Open a command window, and CD to
							<FRAMEWORKSDK>
							\Samples\Setup This is typically : C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 
							.NET\FrameworkSDK\Samples\Setup</DIV>
					<LI>
						<DIV align="left">Type: osql -E -S (local)\NetSDK -i InstNwnd.sql</DIV>
					</LI>
				</UL>
		<H2>Running the Sample</H2>
		<p>Simply press <b>F5</b>.</p>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			When the main form initially loads&nbsp;a&nbsp;dataset is loaded with all 
			rows&nbsp;form the products table in the Northwind database. All manipulations 
			of this product data that subsequently occur are accomplished by filtering/ 
			sorting the disconnected copy of the product data in the dataset through usage 
			of&nbsp;a dataview. The product data is not retreived from the data source 
			after the initial load in order to satisfy any user filter/sort requests.
			<LI>
				Filter criteria specifies the subset of rows based on an 
				expression.&nbsp;Expressions have a very rich syntax which can accommodate 
				complex selection criteria.</LI>
