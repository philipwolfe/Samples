				Language: Creating a Custom Collection Class</h1>
			<p>
				This solution demonstrates the usage of the new 
				System.Collections.CollectionBase class for creating a strongly-typed 
				collection.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				This sample uses two classes: Customer and Customers. Customers inherits from 
				System.Collections.CollectionBase in order to create a type safe collection to 
				manage multiple customer instances. The CollectionBase class exposes an 
				InnerList instance which is used to store Customer instance references.
			</p>
			<P>The Customers class exposes overloaded versions of Add, Item, and Remove to 
				facilitate management of the Customer instances. Unlike earlier versions of 
				Visual Basic where optional parameters might have been used, overloaded members 
				provide a more type safe way of accessing and managing a collection of internal 
				types.</P>
			<P>See the comments in the source code&nbsp;for more information.</P>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<p>
				Enter some data for the first name, last name, and account number in the three 
				text boxes on the main form and click the Add button. This will add a Customer 
				object to the Customers collection with the data you specified. The account 
				number for each&nbsp;customer added to the collection will appear in the 
				listbox. After there is at least one Customer in the collection, you can select 
				it in the listbox. Then you can remove it from the collection or show the 
				details of a particular Customer in the collection. You can also click "Reload 
				from collection" to clear the listbox and reload each item in the collection 
				into the listbox.&nbsp;
