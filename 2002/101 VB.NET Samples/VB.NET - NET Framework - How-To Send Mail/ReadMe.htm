		<h1>
			.NET Framework: Send Email</h1>
		<p>This sample shows how to send email over SMTP using classes in the 
			System.Web.Mail namespace.
		</p>
		<h2>Featured Highlights:</h2>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			This application has&nbsp;a single Windows Form with controls similar to the 
			Microsoft Outlook email client.
			<LI>
			When the Form loads it checks to make sure the user has the SMTP Service 
			installed on their machine and that it is running.
			<LI>
				Simple validation is performed on the "To" and "From" email address fields, 
				with the errors displayed using an ErrorProvider control.</LI></UL>
		<H2>Requirements:</H2>
		<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> SMTP Service must be installed and running. SMTP is an 
			option installed with IIS.</P>
		<P><STRONG>2. </STRONG>To send mail the SmtpServer property must be set to the IP 
			address or server name where the SMTP Server is running. In most cases this is 
			the "localhost" machine. As such, the SmtpServer property value can either be 
			the friendly name, "localhost", or "127.0.0.1". The latter is the default for 
			this application. If you have any trouble sending mail, check to make sure the 
			SmtpServer property is properly set in the code.</P>
		<P>To find the SMTP server name, do the following:
		</P>
		<P>a) Open the IIS snap-in (Start | Control Panel | Administrative Tools | Internet 
			Information Services). (Note: On Win2K this is the Internet Services Manager)
		</P>
		<P>b) Expand the Default SMTP Virtual Server node (the exact name of this node may 
			vary by operating system).
		</P>
		<P>c) Click Domains. In the right pane you will see a list of Domain Names. You may 
			set the SmtpServer property to one of these names or their corresponding IP 
			addresses.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>3. </STRONG>The Default SMTP Virtual Server must also be running. 
			Realize that it is possible for the SMTP Service to be running, but the Default 
			SMTP Server in IIS to be stopped. There is a difference between the service 
			itself and the actual server run by the service. It is akin to having IIS 
			running with a particular Web or FTP site stopped. IIS, the service, is still 
			running. But the particular Web or FTP site is not.
		</P>
		<P>If your Default SMTP Virtual Server is not running, a red X icon will be visible 
			over its node in the IIS snap-in. To start the Server, right-click its node and 
			select Start.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>4. </STRONG>Finally, the Relay Restrictions must be properly set. To do 
			this:
		</P>
		<P>a) In IIS, right-click Default SMTP Virtual Server and select Properties.
		</P>
		<P>b) In the Properties dialog click the Access tab.
		</P>
		<P>c) Click Relay.
		</P>
		<P>d) In the Relay Restrictions dialog, check "All except the list below". The 
			bottom checkbox can be left checked or unchecked.
		</P>
		<P>e) Click OK twice to effect the change and clear the properties dialogs.</P>
