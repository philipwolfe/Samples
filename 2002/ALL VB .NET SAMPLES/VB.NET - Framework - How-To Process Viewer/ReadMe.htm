				.NET Framework: Process Viewer</h1>
			<p>
				This sample uses various classes in System.Diagnostics to&nbsp;gather running 
				process information.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				This&nbsp;Windows Form application uses three list view controls on the main 
				form to show&nbsp;all the processes running on the current machine. Once a 
				process is selected, the supporting list view controls&nbsp;will list 
				additional process data as well as data about the Win32 threads in the process. 
				Note that the thread data shown is gathered via the ThreadInfo class not the 
				System.Threading.Thread class. In addition, a secondary child form can be shown 
				detailing the modules (DLLs) loaded by the process including the name of the 
				file where the code was loaded.
			</p>
			<P>Note that there are three processes that don't supply complete information:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<STRONG>_Total</STRONG>—Used to provide summary execution time, and 
				processor utilization.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>Idle</STRONG>—Not a real process.
				<LI>
					<STRONG>System</STRONG>—Does not&nbsp;expose module information.</LI></UL>
			<P>Clicking on these items will result in clearing of the list views and/or 
				disallowing opening of the Module Detail child form. Note also that when 
				running the program certain process details may not be available for cetain 
				running programs.</P>
			<P>The form&nbsp;uses docking with splitter &amp; panel controls to achieve the 
				desired effect for easy resizing. In addition, there is code to deal with 
				synchronization of data between the three list views. In addition a context 
				menu is used.</P>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<p>
				Press <STRONG>F5</STRONG> to start the application. The list of current 
				processes will be loaded automatically. Click on a process to have its details 
				and thread data loaded. Press <STRONG>Ctrl+V</STRONG> or use the menus to view 
				the list of modules loaded by a particular process. Press <STRONG>F5</STRONG> while 
				the program is running to refresh the list of the processes.
