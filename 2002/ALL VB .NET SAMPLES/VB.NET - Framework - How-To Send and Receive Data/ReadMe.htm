				.NET Framework: Send &amp; Receive Data via HTTP</h1>
			<p>
				This solution demonstrates how to send &amp; receive data using HTTP and 
				streams using the System.Net classes.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<P>There are 4 command buttons, 2 text boxes, and a picture box. Additionally, 
				there is a virtual directory named VDir1 that receives and returns data. The 
				first 3 buttons show how to send and receive data from a file. The last button 
				shows how to send text back and forth to the web application. When using the 
				fourth button, the text in the editable text box is sent to the web server, and 
				the returned text is displayed in the read-only text box.</P>
			<P>The Windows application relies upon 4 ASPX files living in the VDir1 directory.
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<P>The application communicates with a virtual directory served up by IIS. By 
				default, the directory is&nbsp;located in a&nbsp;sub-directory below the 
				solution.&nbsp;The virtual directory must be configured using the Internet 
				Services Manager. Name the virtual directory <STRONG>VDir1</STRONG>, associate 
				it with the VDir1 directly, and accept all defaults.
			</P>
			<P>File I/O is performed in&nbsp;&amp; out of the files using FileStreams. Network 
				I/O is performed between client &amp; server using Request and Response 
				streams.</P>
			<P>There are three data files used in this sammple:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				datafile.txt
				<LI>
				mypic.jpg
				<LI>
					myxmlfile.xml</LI></UL>
			<P>All three are expected to be in the VDir1 directory. In addition, a copy of the 
				file <STRONG>datafile.txt</STRONG> should be in the same location as the main 
				exe (which by default is the bin directory).&nbsp;</P>
