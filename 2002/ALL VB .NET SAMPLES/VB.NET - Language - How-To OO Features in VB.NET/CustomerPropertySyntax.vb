		' This is the Constructor for this class.

		' Normally, you would use the AccountNumber string to search a
		' database or collection for the customer's account number.
		' Here, we're just going to populate a Customer object with
		' dummy data.
		'
		' Because the account number is a ReadOnly property,
		' we need to set the private custAccount variable
		' directly rather than calling the property procedure.

	' The following line is the property declaration
	' for the AccountNumber property. This line is
	' referred to as the "property statement".
	Public ReadOnly Property AccountNumber() As String

		' Most properties are read/write, which means they
		' can be evaluated or changed by the calling code.
		' When a property is read/write you have both a
		' Get portion and a Set portion of code within
		' the property code. The Get and Set portions of
		' the property are referred to as the "property
		' procedures".

		' Because this property is flagged ReadOnly, there
		' is only a Get property procedure with no matching 
		' "Set" property procedure.

		' Alternatively you can have a property that is
		' write only by declaring the property "WriteOnly"
		' instead of ReadOnly. In that case you would have
		' a Set with no Get.

		' Note: A property's data type and access are defined 
		' in the Property statement, not in the Property 
		' procedures. A property can have only one data type 
		' and one accessibility. For example, you cannot define 
		' a property to set a Decimal value, but get a Double 
		' value. Similarly, you cannot define a Private Set and 
		' a Public Get on the same property. To achieve this 
		' functionality, you can define a Public ReadOnly 
		' property and a Private setting method separate from 
		' the property.
