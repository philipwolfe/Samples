		<h1>Windows Forms: How to Create an Explorer-Style Application</h1>
		<p>This "How To" contains two sample applications that are both Explorer-like: 
			DirectoryScanner and ExplorerStyleViewer. The former is a simpler example of an 
			Explorer-style application, while the latter seeks to mimic some of the core 
			features of Windows Explorer.</p>
		<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
		<UL>
			<LI>
				<STRONG>DirectoryScanner</STRONG> is a fairly simple application that scans all 
				directories and sub-directories in either all logical drives or a user-selected 
				starting directory. A TreeView control displays the directory structure 
				reflecting the latest scan. Directories are colored green, yellow, or red based 
				on their total size inclusive of all sub-directories and files.</LI>
			<LI>
				<STRONG>ExplorerStyleViewer</STRONG> is, as the name implies, a simpler version 
				of the Windows Explorer application. ExplorerStyleViewer makes known more file 
				information than DirectoryScanner, demonstrates how to associate icons with 
				file types, and allows the user to run an application associated with the file 
				type (if an association exists) by double-clicking the file (just like in 
				Windows Explorer).</LI></UL>
		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Microsoft Visual Studio.NET Professional or greater.<br>
        Windows 2000 or Windows XP.</p>
		<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
		<p>Simply press <b>F5</b>.</p>
		<p><STRONG style="font-weight: 400">1.</STRONG> The Nodes.Count property does not appear in IntelliSense in 
			Visual Basic. (A similar problem occurs with PictureBox.AllowDrop). You can 
			still set this property programmatically, but you will get a precompile error 
			as you type until statement completion.</p>
