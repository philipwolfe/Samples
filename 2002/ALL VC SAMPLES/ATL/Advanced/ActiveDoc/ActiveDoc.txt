ActiveX Document Sample

This sample demonstrates how to implement an ActiveX Document
Server. The program demonstrates the following:

 * How to implement the interfaces IOleDocument and IOleDocumentView
 * How to perform menu merging with the container
 * How to implement a toolbar in your object
 * How to override IPersistStreamInit Load and Save to perform custom
	saving and loading
 * How to use CDialogImpl to implement an About dialog box.
 * How to subclass the Rich Text Edit Control

To use the sample, build the project. Then, there are 2 ways of running
this sample:

1. Open the ActiveDoc.htm or ActiveDoc.AAA generated file in Internet
Explorer (to open ActiveDoc.AAA, click Open button when prompted to open
this file). Use the Format menu that has been merged into Explorer's menu
bar, or just click on toolbar colors to change the color of the typed text.

2. If you have Microsoft Office Binder, run it and from the Section menu
select Add. You should then see an icon labeled ActiveDoc Class. Select
this icon and click OK. You should see the object embedded in Office Binder.
Notice that the menus have been merged and the ActiveDoc's toolbar is shown.
You can enter text and use the menu and toolbar buttons to change the color
of the text that is typed.

The sample contains the following main files:

Menu.h        - Code to handle menu merging and sharing
ActiveDoc.cpp - Implementation of DLL Exports
ActiveCtl.h   - Declaration of the CActiveDoc class
ActiveCtl.cpp - Implements CActiveDoc which represents the
		overall ActiveDoc object
OleDocument.h - Contains the implementation of the IOleDocument
		and IOleDocumentView interfaces.
Toolbar.h     - Contains CToolbar which helps with the
		implementation of the toolbar
