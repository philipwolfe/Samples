BEEPER

This basic sample illustrates the implementation of a tearoff interface - a
collection/enumeration of BSTRs. It can be built as a DLL and as an EXE.


HOW TO RUN IT:

Build BEEPER (.EXE or .DLL) and make sure it is registered. With the DLL version, you
can also use BEEPER.HTM (HTML file that uses VBScript) from Internet Explorer.
