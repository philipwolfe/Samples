CIRCCOLL

This sample shows how to implement a collection/enumeration of objects using ATL and STL. Three object
classes are implemented: the collection creator, the collection, and the object inside the collection.
Only the collection creator has a CoClass associated with it (see CIRCCOLL.IDL for details). The collection
creator has a method to return a collection of "circle" objects. The collection object implements the
"Item()", "Count()" and "_NewItem()" methods, so that the object can be manipulated from VB using both the
For ... Next and For Each ... syntax.
