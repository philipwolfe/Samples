LABRADOR

This sample shows how to use ATL to implement an EXE server without any user interface. The server
allows creation of an object that supports two custom interfaces, as defined in LABRADOR.IDL.

HOW TO RUN IT:

You need to build and properly set up 3 components, but building and running the sample from the IDE does
all of this for you in one step. Just build the sample solution labrador.sln and from Debug menu select
"Run Without Debugging" or just click on the ">" button.

The 3 steps for building from command line are as follows:
* Server:
  Build LABRADOR.EXE. Run the server once with the /RegServer command line option to set up the registry
* Marshalling DLL:
  Build the proxy/stub marshalling DLL to get LABPS.DLL. Register it by running "regsvr32 labps.dll"
* Driver:
  Go to the LABDRIV subdirectory, build LABDRIV.EXE. Run the driver from the debugger or from the command
  line. The driver will create an object, make a few calls into it, and then release it.
