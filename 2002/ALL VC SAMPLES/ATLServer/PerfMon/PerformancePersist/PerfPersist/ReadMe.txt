       ATL SERVER : PerfPersist Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this PerfPersist application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the ATL Server Classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your PerfPersist application.

PerfPersist.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.
PerfPersistDeploy.vdproj
    This is the main project file for Deployment projects. It will deploy all required
	content and executables to the server and virtual directory you specified in the 
	wizard.  If the virtual directory does not exist, it will create a directory under
	the default web site for the server and deploy to that location.
PerfPersist.cpp
PerfPersist.h
	This file contains your ATL Server request handler class customized based on the 
	options you chose in the the ATL Server Wizard.
PerfPersist.srf
	This file contains a starter SRF (Server Response File) for your application.
	It shows a sample usage of the replacement tag {{Hello}} which is 
	associated with the OnHello method in the CPerfPersistHandler class.
