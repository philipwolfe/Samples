       ATL SERVER : atlrt Project Overview
========================================================================

ATLRT exposes a set of 'generic' replacement methods that can be used to build simple
ATL Server web applications.  The following steps are required to install ATLRT:

1. create a virtual directory
2. copy atlrt.dll to the physical location of your virtual directory
3. create an application in your virtual directory
4. register atlrt.dll as the .srf handler for this application
5. copy atlrt.srf into your virtual directory

Atlrt.srf is a sample SRF file that you can access your browser to ensure that the steps above worked.  
Please see atlrt.srf for instructions on setting up your database to use the data access functionality of ATLRT.
