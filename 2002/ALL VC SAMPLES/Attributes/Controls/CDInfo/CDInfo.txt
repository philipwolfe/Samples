CDINFO

The CD Info sample draws a pie chart representing the length of
tracks off the audio CD that is in the drive. It uses the Media
Control Interface (MCI) APIs to retrieve this information. The
sample also demonstrates how to use the tooltip common control
to implement tooltips for your control. The tooltip displays
the track length for the track represented by the pie chart
segment that the cursor is over.

There is a VB sample in the VBTEST subdirectory that demonstrates
use of the control.

The control implements the following Methods
Read:
	Reads the track length information from the CD in the
	drive and displays the information in the form of a pie chart.
Redraw:
	Redraws the pie chart for the current CD.
Play:
	Starts playing the CD at the passed track number. The
	control also rotates the pie chart so that the played
	track will be at the top.

The following properties are available.

	The number of tracks on the CD.
Length:
	The length of the passed track number in seconds.
