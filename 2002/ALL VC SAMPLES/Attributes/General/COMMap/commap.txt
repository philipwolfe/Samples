COMMAP

   This basic sample shows how different COM interface
   map entry macros are used.

HOW TO RUN IT:

   Build AGGREG.DLL first, then build COMMAP.DLL. Use COMMAP.HTM
   (HTML file that uses VBScript)  from Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0.
   COMMAP.HTM  includes comments about each type of map entry. You
   can also load the .VBP file into VB and run.
