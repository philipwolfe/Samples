ALLINONE:  Implements a server using ATL, exposing STL collections, controlled by
compiler COM support in an MFC App

This sample shows the ability of ATL/STL/VCCOM/MFC to coexist.  Building on the collect
MFC example, nine collections are implemented in STL -- using map, multimap, list, vector, deque 
and set -- which are exposed as custom interfaces using ATL with multiple types of aggregation.  
The MFC controller uses compiler COM support.

Compare this sample with COLLECT in samples\mfc\advanced.

Running the sample:

The Server:
    1.  Build stlcoll.dll/stlcoll.exe using the stlcoll project in samples\com\allinone\server.
    2.  Self-registration should take place in the custom build step -- otherwise run:
        regsvr32 stlcoll.dll
    or
        stlcoll /RegServer

The Proxy/Stub DLL:
    1.  Build stlcollps.dll using the stlcoll project in samples\com\allinone\server.
        This is only needed when stlcoll.exe is out-of-proc.
    2.  Self-registration should take place in the custom build step -- otherwise run:
        regsvr32 stlcoll.dll

The Controller:
    1.  Build collect.exe using the collect project in samples\com\allinone\collect.


This sample demonstrates the following key words:

    custom interface, ATL, STL, map, vector, set, multimap, list, deque, _com_ptr_t, _bstr_t,
    _com_error, aggregation, tearoff interface
