  File:      GUIBALL.H

  Summary:   Include file for the CGuiBall C++ class. A GuiBall is a C++
             object that uses three independent worker threads to display
             a moving and bouncing ball in the client area of a designated
             window.  It is anchored to the Windows GUI (Graphical User
             Interface) environment. This GuiBall object continuously
             paints a ball image based on data it obtains from a virtual
             ball object. This virtual ball object is instantiated as a
             COM object (a COBall) in a separate In-process server,
             FRESERVE.

             GuiBall launches three threads which all continuously and
             asynchronously command the ball to move. GuiBall itself
             provides methods to initialize the GuiBall, paint the ball
             image, and restart the motion.

             For a comprehensive tutorial code tour of GUIBALL's contents
             and offerings see the accompanying FRECLIEN.TXT file. For more
             specific technical details on the internal workings see the
             comments dispersed throughout the GUIBALL source code.

  Class:    CGuiBall

  Summary:  Class to encapsulate the displayable Graphical User
            Interface GUI Ball object.

  Methods:  CGuiBall
              Constructor.
            ~CGuiBall
              Destructor.
            BOOL Init(HWND hWnd);
              Initialize the GuiBall.
            void PaintBall(void);
              Paint one image of the Ball.
            void Restart(void);
              Restart the process including clear window, move ball to
              start position, restart motion.
            void PaintWin(void);
              Repaint the window but don't restart motion.
