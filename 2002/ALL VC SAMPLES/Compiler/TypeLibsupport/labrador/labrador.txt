LABRADOR

This sample shows how to use ATL to implement an EXE server without any user interface. The server 
allows creation of an object that supports two custom interfaces, as defined in LABRADOR.IDL.

HOW TO RUN IT:

Build the solution. Note that a compiler warning will occur because this sample uses 
CComModule. Refer to the ATL version of this sample to see how to use CAtlExeModule. 
Set labdriv as the start up project. 
Select Start Without Debugging from the Debug menu.
