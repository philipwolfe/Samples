Steps to convert the CALCDRIV project to compiler native COM support:

1.  Insert ..\mfccalc\mfccalc.odl in project source files.

2.  Change project settings.OLE types for all targets (debug, release, Unicode, etc.) to 
    place .tlb file in project source directory instead of target specific directory.

3.  Remove calctype.cpp and calctype.h from the project.
