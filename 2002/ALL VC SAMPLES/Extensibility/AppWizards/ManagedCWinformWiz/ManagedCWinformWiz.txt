To install the wizard
1.	Copy all of the sample files to your hard disk.
2.	Copy the contents of the VCProjects folder to the Vc7\VCProjects folder in the directory where Visual Studio is installed. (for example, c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\VCProjects\).
3.	Copy the contents of the VCWizards folder to the Vc7\VCWizards folder in the directory where Visual Studio is installed. (for example, c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\VCWizards\).

The wizard will be available the next time that you select File, New Project in Visual Studio. See the sample abstract in online help for more information.

When building a wizard generated project, a PDB file, which is needed to debug the application, will not be generated.
To create one set the c++ compiler property “Debug Information Format” to “Program Database (/Zi)” and the linker property “Generate Debug Info” to “yes (/DEBUG)”.
