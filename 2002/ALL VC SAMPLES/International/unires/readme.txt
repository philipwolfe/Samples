Abstract:
This sample demonstrates how to create a Win32 application with only Unicode 
string resources and how to integrate a Unicode .RC file into a project. As 
the resource editor only supports ANSI in Visual Studio .NET modifications
to the .RC file have to be made in the source editor.

System Requirements:
Windows 2000 or higher with language support for all languages installed. If 
you are seeing squares instead of characters in some lines check in the 
Control Panel under Regional Options if all check boxes under 
"Language Support for the System" are selected.
