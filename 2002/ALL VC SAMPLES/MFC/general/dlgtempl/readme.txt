	   MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : dlgtemp
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this dlgtemp application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your dlgtemp application.

dlgtemp.h
	This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
	project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
	CDlgtempApp application class.

dlgtemp.cpp
	This is the main application source file that contains the application
	class CDlgtempApp.

dlgtemp.rc
	This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
	program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
	in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Developer Studio.

res\dlgtemp.ico
	This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
	icon is included by the main resource file dlgtemp.rc.

res\dlgtemp.rc2
	This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft
	Developer Studio.  You should place all resources not
	editable by the resource editor in this file.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one dialog class:

dlgtempDlg.h, dlgtempDlg.cpp - the dialog
	These files contain your CDlgtempDlg class.  This class defines
	the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's
	template is in dlgtemp.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft
	Developer Studio.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
	These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
	named dlgtemp.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
	This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
	Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
