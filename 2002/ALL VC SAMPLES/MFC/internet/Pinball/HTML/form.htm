The Pinball sample shows how to process a form which has several
radio buttons. When called without parameters, the sample will
display this form. If you select a pinball game, the form will
send the extension a request that looks like this:<br>
<br>
<code>pinball.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetImage&Favorite=1</code><br>
<br>
where the value of the <code>Favorite</code> parameter actually
indicates the machine choice you have made. In response, the sample
will use the <code>CHttpServerContext::TransmitFile()</code> function
to send you a large graphics file showing the backglass artwork for
the machine you've selected. The TransmitFile() API provides a very
efficient and scaleable way to send large files from disk on the server
to the client machine.<br>
<br>
If you mark the "I don't see it here" button, the browser will send
<code>Favorite=0</code>, and the server will  respond with a redirection
to the Internet Pinball Database, a popular public Internet site for
pinball enthusiasts.<br>
<br>
For this sample to properly work, you must have copied the *.GIF and
*.JPG files from the sample into the same directory as the PINBALL.DLL
file. See the sample abstract in online help for more details.<br>
<br>
This sample was tested with Internet Explorer 4.01 and
Netscape Navigator 3.0.
