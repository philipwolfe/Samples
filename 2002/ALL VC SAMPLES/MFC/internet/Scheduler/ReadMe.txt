    MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : Scheduler Project Overview
===============================================================================

AppWizard has created this Scheduler application for you.  This application
not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation Classes
but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your Scheduler application.

Scheduler.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

Scheduler.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the
    CSchedulerApp application class.

Scheduler.cpp
    This is the main application source file that contains the application
    class CSchedulerApp.

Scheduler.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
    Visual C++. Your project resources are in 1033.

res\Scheduler.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
    icon is included by the main resource file Scheduler.rc.

res\Scheduler.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 
    Visual C++. You should place all resources not editable by
    the resource editor in this file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

AppWizard creates one dialog class:
SchedulerDlg.h, SchedulerDlg.cpp - the dialog
    These files contain your CSchedulerDlg class.  This class defines
    the behavior of your application's main dialog.  The dialog's template is
    in Scheduler.rc, which can be edited in Microsoft Visual C++.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Other Features:

ActiveX Controls
    The application includes support to use ActiveX controls.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named Scheduler.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
