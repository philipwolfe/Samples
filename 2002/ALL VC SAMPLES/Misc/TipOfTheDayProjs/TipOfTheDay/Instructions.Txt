NOTES:
This sample ATL Server is just a sample of what can be done 
with the new ATL Server Project in VS.NET. What is great 
about the ATL Server is that it does not require the VS.NET 
runtime for it to be deployed and working on a remote machine. 
The only requirement is a few DLL's that are packaged in the 
deployment solution and the ATL7.DLL.
