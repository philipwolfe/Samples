Provides a way to manage files that are dynamically generated by ASP.NET applications (like images, charts, etc.). Files can be created, stored, accessed, and are automatically collected after a configurable amount of time.

Files are stored with a unique ID and can later be referenced directly through a URL only within the session which created the file. Timeouts, MIME types, paths, etc. are configurable through the web.config.

A sample web app which creates JPGs on the fly is included.

The sample consists of two pieces. The file manager class which the app uses to manipulate its files and an HttpHandler which serves up the files.

=====================================
Installation

unzip the zipfile with paths and create a web site that points to the DynamicFiles\DynamicFiles folder 

In the IIS configuration control panel 
1) open the properties on the web site 
2) select Configuration 
3) in mappings Add a new mapping 	
	i.	set the extension to what you want your file extensions to be (my example uses .dfm)
	ii.	limit verbs to “GET”
	iii.	uncheck “check that file exists”
	iv.	set the executable to “C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.XXXX\aspnet_isapi.dll” - copy the mapping from the ASPX extension
4) in the web.config file 
	i.	ensure the handler is registered for the same file extension as in IIS 
	ii.	verify the AppSettings settings are correct for your file types
