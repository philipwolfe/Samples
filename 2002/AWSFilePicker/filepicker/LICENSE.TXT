SOMETHING REMINDING A DECLAIMER

This is a free, open source software component that expected to be investigated and maybe even modified by you. You may find useful discovering methods of work with file system objects in .Net, data binding to non-standard data sources and implementing pop-up browser windows in the ASP.Net environment. 
You can distribute this component without any restrictions. If you desire, you even can also try to sell it. However, it would be interesting for me to get to know of the results ;-).
This is likely to be not the first freeware component you are going to employ, so all the common licensing features you often see ("as is", no warranty, no obligations, etc.) are applicable to this software also.
