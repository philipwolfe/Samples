.NET Library for the Data Protection API (DPAPI)

The Dpapi is used to hide secrets like connection strings and user credentials that are typically stored in a config file. Instead of storing the plain text, you can use Dpapi to encrypt and decrypt the secrets at a machine or user specific level.

See DpapiDocumentation.chm for a technical guide to the component and the Sample project for an example of how to use the component.
