Model description       : 

	The Forgotten One brings to an end my long running obsession with making a winged model.  

Other info              : 
	
*******************Warning**********************
Forgotten One has a issue with the bounding box. His wings stick out of the box at numerous points in the animations. I tried to keep it as tight as posible, but I think the coolness of the wings makes up for the bounding box issues they cause, If you shoot at the blue parts you will score hits ;P .  If you are very very picky about these kinda things, I included a version without the wings, much like the Necromicus/Morticus model.
