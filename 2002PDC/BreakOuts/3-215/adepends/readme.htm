<P>Adepends is a tool that shows the structure of an assembly and its 
dependencies.&nbsp; By default, the information is shown in graphical form, but 
the -C option can be used to send the output to the console.&nbsp; The command 
line to adepends includes a file containing the manifest for the assembly you'd 
like to display.&nbsp; For example: "adepends math.exe".&nbsp; </P>
<P>This tool is unsupported in the PDC Tech Preview.&nbsp; It will likely be 
included in the SDK in a future release.</P>     </BODY></HTML>
