Notes...

This application is not ported over from C# version.

I created a similar User Interface using WinDes then manually 
added the code to make it work.  Adding the events was very 
painful.

This is functionally similar except I had the image move in
the direction of the scrollbar instead of away from it.

I wasn't able to get the resource file to work so I'm loading 
the BMP into the PictureBox with code.
