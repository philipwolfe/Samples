If <VAR>equalitypred</VAR> is not an equivalence relation,
then the program is inconsistent: its declarative semantics 
contains a contradiction, because the additional axioms for the user-defined
equality contradict the standard equality axioms.  That implies that the
implementation may compute any answer at all (see section <A HREF="reference_manual.html#SEC62">Semantics</A>),
i.e. the behaviour of the program is undefined.
