<H3><A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="transition_guide.html#FOOT1">(1)</A></H3>

The Mercury compiler was originally bootstrapped using
NU-Prolog and SICStus Prolog.  We needed to use cuts for
efficiency in a few places.  Of course, now that we compile
the Mercury compiler with itself the cuts are not needed
--- and it runs much faster anyway.
