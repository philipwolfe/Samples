            Interop Services provided by the System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace allows the .NET Framework 2.0 to access legacy or unmanaged code from with managed code.</p>
        <p>
            This sample demonstrates improved interop abilities such as the ability to wrap
            native function pointers into delegates and the ability to marshal fixed-size arrays
            of structures inside structures.&nbsp; The PinvokeLib.dll library is provided as
            a part of this solution and defines the MyPoint structure and the MyRectangle structure
            that contains an array of MyPoint structures representing the topLeft and bottomRight
            points of a rectangle.&nbsp; This MyRectangle structure is filled through interop
            marshaling.&nbsp; The DLL calculates the area of this rectangle and returns this
            value through a function return or through a callback.</p>
