        Using NGEN</h1>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">
        The .NET Framework 2.0 contains an enhanced version of the NGEN command-line utility
        which is used to generate native code assemblies in place of run-time JIT compilation.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">

    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">
        This sample allows you to install and uninstall native images from the Native Image Cache.
        Installing an image is performed by the NGEN utility which will first generate the native
        image file from a compiled .NET assembly, and then install the native image into the cache.
        </p><p></p>
    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">
        This sample comes with two additional projects, ConsoleApp and SharedLib1. ConsoleApp is 
        dependent on SharedLib1. You are encouraged to install ConsoleApp.exe into the Native Image 
        Cache by browsing to the file in the ConsoleApp\bin\debug directory. After it is installed,
        you can choose to view the entire contents of the Native Image Cache. You will find that the
        SharedLib1 assembly was also installed into the cache as a result of ConsoleApp's dependence 
        on this shared assembly. Automatically installing dependent assemblies is one of the new 
        features provided in the .NET Framework's 2.0 version of NGEN.
        </p><p></p>
    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">      
        When you view the Native Image Cache, you will see that each native image is displayed in four 
        parts representing the four parts of a full assembly name (base name, version, culture and 
        public key token). Once the native images are displayed in the ListView control, you can select 
        one or more of them and uninstall them from the cache. Please be aware, however, that removing 
        system assemblies from the native image cache can have an adverse effect on performance of all 
        .NET applications. For this reason, we encourage you to experiment with the sample console
        application provided and with your own development projects.

    <p style="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in; font-family: Verdana; mso-outline-level: 1">
        For many application deployments, NGEN is not necessary or may provide limited benefit.
        You should carefully consider whether NGEN is appropriate for your application before
        applying it in a production environment.</p>
