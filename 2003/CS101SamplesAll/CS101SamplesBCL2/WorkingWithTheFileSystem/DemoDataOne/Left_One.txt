The most familiar file systems make use of an underlying data storage
device that offers access to an array of fixed-size blocks, sometimes
called sectors, generally 512 bytes each. The file system software is
responsible for organizing these sectors into files and directories,
and keeping track of which sectors belong to which file and which are
not being used.

However, file systems need not make use of a storage device at all. A
file system can be used to organize and represent access to any data,
whether it be stored or dynamically generated (eg, from a network
connection).
