Traditional filesystems also offer facilities to truncate, append to,
create, move, delete and in-place modify files. They do not offer
facilities to prepend to or truncate from the beginning of a file, let
alone arbitrary insertion into or deletion from a file. The operations
provided are highly asymmetric and lack the generality to be useful in
unexpected contexts. For example, interprocess pipes in Unix have to be
implemented outside of the filesystem because it does not offer
truncation from the beginning of files.

Secure access to basic file system operations can be based on a scheme
of access control lists or capabilities. Research has shown access
control lists to be difficult to secure properly, which is why research
operating systems tend to use capabilities. Commercial file systems
still use access control lists.
