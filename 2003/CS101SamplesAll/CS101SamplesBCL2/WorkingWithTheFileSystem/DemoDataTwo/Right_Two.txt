Whether the file system has an underlying storage device or not, file
systems typically have directories which associate file names with
files, usually by connecting the file name to an index into a file
allocation table of some sort, such as the FAT in an MS-DOS file
system, or an inode in a UNIX-like filesystem. Directory structures may
be flat, or allow hierarchies where directories may contain
subdirectories. In some file systems, file names are structured, with
special syntax for filename extensions and version numbers. In others,
file names are simple strings, and per-file metadata is stored
elsewhere.

Traditional filesystems offer facilities to create, move and delete
both files and directories. They lack facilities to create additional
links to a directory (hard links in Unix), rename parent links (".." in
Unix-like OS), and create bidirectional links to files.
