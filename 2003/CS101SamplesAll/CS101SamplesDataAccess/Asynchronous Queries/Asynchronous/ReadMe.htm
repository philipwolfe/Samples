        <h1>Asynchronous Queries Sample</h1>
        With SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, you can process Asynchronous data request by three different methods.  
        The first technique is polling.  This method accesses the IAsyncResult property to determine if the asynchronous process has
        completed.  While it is still processing other tasks can be completed.
        <p></p>
        The second technique involves using Callbacks to handle when asynchronous requests have completed.  With this technique, you
        register delegates that handle the results as they return from processing.  When we BeginExecuteReader, we pass in a AsyncCallback
        object which contains a reference to the method that will be called when the process returns.  This method then calls the methods defined
        in the delegates to display information on the user interface.
        <p></p>
        The third method uses WaitHandles to process results as they complete.  As each BegineExecuteReader object is called, a WaitHandle is created
        by calling the AsyncWaitHandle of the IAsyncResult object.  These Wait Handles are then stored in an array for processing.  As processing continues,
        the WaitAny method of the WaitHandle object returns the index of the WaitHandle that is finished processing. As each process completes,
        specific processing is called for each process.
        
        <p></p>
        In this example, you exercise each of these techniques.  First load the database with data by clicking on the "Fill Tables" button.  Then, to see 
        polling, click the "Polling" button.  Next, to view the Callback technique, click the "Callback" button.  Finally, to view the WaitHandle 
        method, click the "Wait" button.  In the Test Results group box, you will see the performance of each of these techiniques as well
        as the user messages that are generated.
