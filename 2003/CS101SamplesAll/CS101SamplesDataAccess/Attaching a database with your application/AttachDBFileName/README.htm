        <h1>Attaching a Database with your application</h1>
        With ADO.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005, you can easily connect to databases by using just the filename instead of using 
        the data providers in an OLEDB connection or a SQLConnection.<p></p>
        This example shows you how easy it is to connect to a database using a file name with just a few lines of code.
        <p></p>
        In this example, you insert rows into two different databases. First, you select how many rows you want to insert
        into a particular database.  Then you select which insert method you will use, stored procedure or query text.
        Next, you can select which database you want to connect to.  Finally, you click the Run Test button and the results of 
        the insert is displayed in the Text Results group box.
        
        <p></p>
        Note: To run this sample, make sure you have proper execute permissions on your database files in the bin folder.  
        <p></p>        
        <b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
        <ul>
        
        <li>Visual Studio 2005.</li>
        <li>SQL Server Express 2005.</li>
	    </ul>
