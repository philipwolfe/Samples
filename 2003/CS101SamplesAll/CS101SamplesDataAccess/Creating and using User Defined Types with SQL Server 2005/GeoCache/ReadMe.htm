    <h1>
        Functionality shown in this sample:</h1>
    When prompted upon opening this solution, manually connect to an SQL Server instance
    and select the tempdb database.
    <p>
    </p>In this example, you see how to implement a User Defined Type and use it within
    a Windows Form. User Defined Types allow us to group data together into one defined
    type that can be accessed in one type.
    <p>
    </p>
    To run this example, you may need to execute the following statement to allow these
    stored procedures and user defined functions to be executed within the code:
    <p>
        sp_configure @configname = 'clr enabled', @configvalue = 1<br />
        RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE<br />
        GO<br />
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    You may also need to deploy the UDT project manually if it does not automatically
    deploy when the project is run.
    <p>
    </p>
    In this example, enter a longitude and latitude value and a city that is associated
    to that particular data point. Clicking the Enter a New GeoCache Location button
    inserts the user data into the user defined data type. After the data is inserted,
    the complete table contents are displaysed in the rich text box.
    <p>
    </p>
    To re-run this sample, first drop the MyData table and then start again otherwise,
    you will receive a deploy error for the User-Defined type.
    <p>

    This sample requires the following to be installed:
    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
        <li>SQL Server 2005</li>
    </ul>
