        <h1>DataSet and DataTable Enhancements</h1>
        With ADO.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005, there have been a number of enhancements made to DataSets and DataTables.
        <p></p>
        In this Example, we will look at three different scenarios where DataTables and DataSets have increased in performance or functionality.
        <p></p>
        In the first tab, you will see a basic performance analysis when adding a large number of rows to a DataTable and then reading those rows binding them to a DataGridView.
        <p></p>
        In the second tab, you will see how the DataTable has been extended to allow you to easily write data to an XML file as well as fill a DataTable with data from an XML file.  The performance measurements from these actions are also displayed.
        <p></p>
        Finally, in the third tab, you will see how the DataTable has extended its functionality to allow you to create a new DataView displaying only the columns you want, sending it to a new DataTable and binding it to a DataGridView all within a few lines of code.
        
        <p></p>
