        <h1>Batch Updates and Paging</h1>
        With ADO.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005, you can now take advantage of a new property, BatchUpdateSize, when updating records from your
        DataSet to the final database.  Previously, when you committed records to the database from a DataSet, it would update each record individually.
        For small DataSets, this did not create any performance issues.  However, as the number of changes increased, the number of round-trips to the 
        database increased resulting in decreased performance. 
        <p></p>
        With ADO.NET 2.0 and BatchUpdateSize, you can expicitly set the size of the batch that will be updated to the database from the DataSet.  This 
        provides a significant increase in performance over its predecessor.
        <p></p>
        In this example, you can view the performance and the resulting updating technique leveraged when inserting a number of rows into a DataSet.
        If you choose "0" from the ComboBox, a single batch containing all the records will be sent to the database.  Conversely, if you select "1" from
        the ComboBox, you will insert each record individually just as it was done previously.  Finally, you can choose different batch sizes and 
        compare the resulting performance change.
