        Notifications Sample</h1>
    In this example, you see how to leverage the SqlDependency object using SQL Notification
    Services to return notification whenever data has been changed even if the connection
    to the database has been closed with the associated SqlCommand.
    <p>
    </p>
    In this example, enter a value and click the Insert Data button. A notification
    is sent back to the user indicating that the data has changed. Clicking the GetData
    will show the changes in data.
    <br />
    Finally, selecting an ID and clicking the Update Data button also returns returns
    a notification.

    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
        <li>SQL Server 2005</li>
