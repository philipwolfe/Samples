        <h1>XPath and XSL Transformations Sample</h1>
        <p></p>
        Using XPath queries and XSL transformations, you can easily display XML data in a web browser.&nbsp;
        With the new XmlReader you can load the results from a database.  The results are then put into an XML document.
		The XmlDocument class allows you to search on the XML results that are stored in the reader for further processing.
		Finally, the XmlNavigator and XPathNodeIterator classes along with XPath queries allows you to filter the results that are stored
		in the XmlDocument.
		<p></p>
		With the filtered results you can use the new XslCompiledTransform class to transform the data with an 
		XSL style sheet into a format that can be displayed in a browser.
		<p></p>
        In this example, we see how to use XPath queries and XSL Transformations to filter results retrieved from a database and
        displayed in the Web browser control.  The first step is to load the data into the database by clicking on "Load XML".  After the data is
        loaded, select the price by which you would like to filter the results.  Finally, click on "Display Data" to display the results in the Web 
        Browser control. The Test Results area shows you how much time was required to perform these operations and how many rows 
        were returned.
