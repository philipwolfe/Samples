<h1>
    Creating Setup CAB</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 make it easier to
        deploy smart device applications.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates how to create a CAB file for an application.&nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        Deployment is the process by which you transfer an application to the target device.&nbsp;
        Before you can deploy your solution, you must package it into a CAB file. A CAB
        file is a type of executable archive file that contains the application, dependencies
        such as DLLs, resources, help files, and any other files you want to include.<br />
        <br />
        This SetupCAB project creates and inserts registry values and an application
        shortcut. &nbsp;The CABDemo application demonstrates reading the registry values
        inserted by the CAB file.&nbsp; Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 provides tools for packaging
        your CAB file. It does not provide any tools for deploying the CAB file to a target
        device or to the emulator.&nbsp; Drag the CAB file from your desktop machine to
        your device using an ActiveSync connection.&nbsp; After the CAB file is copied to
        the target device, tap on it to explode the CAB file and begin the installation
        process.<br />
