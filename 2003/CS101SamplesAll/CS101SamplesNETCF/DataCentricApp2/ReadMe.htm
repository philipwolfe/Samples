The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the new SqlCeResultSet object, the SqlCeDataReader object
        and how to easily build a master detail page with a landscape orientation.&nbsp;
        The SqlCeResultSet is essentially an updatable, scrolling SQL Mobile cursor.&nbsp;
        In this sample a SQL Mobile 2005 database is created and populated at "\My Documents\Personal\Contacts.sdf".  One master table named "Contact" is populated and a detail table name "Address"
        is&nbsp; populated. &nbsp;When selecting a different contact in the ListBox, the
        detail address record is retrieved and diplayed using a SqlCeDataReader. &nbsp;Because the SqlCeResultSet requires an open connection to the databse, the connection object is a form member and is not closed until the form is closed.&nbsp; The database is not deleted when the sample is closed and must be deleted manually.
