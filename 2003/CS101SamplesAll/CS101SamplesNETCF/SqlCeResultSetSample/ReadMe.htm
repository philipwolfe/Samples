<h1>SqlCeResultSet Sample</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the new SqlCeResultSet object which is essentially an updatable, scrolling SQL Mobile cursor.  In this sample a SQL Mobile 2005 database is created at "\My Documents\Personal\Contacts.sdf".  One table named "Contact" is populated with 10 records.  Because the SqlCeResultSet requires an open connection to the databse, the connection object is a form member and is not closed until the form is closed.  This sample demonstrates how a DataGrid and SqlCeResultSet may be used to increment through data, add and delete records and ultimately update the "in- memory" changes to the underlying database.  You can verify the changes by using the Query Analyzer on the Pocket PC.  The database is not deleted when the sample is closed and must be deleted manually.
<p></p>
<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.</li>
</ul>
