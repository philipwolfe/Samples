<h1>
    WebBrowser Sample</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 make it easier to
        deploy smart device applications.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the new WebBrowser control, the new Splitter control and
        the new LinkLabel control.<br />
        <br />
        With the WebBrowser control you can view both offline and online content.&nbsp;
        This sample demonstrates both types of content, but to access online content, an
        online connection must exist.&nbsp; The emulator will not display online content.&nbsp;
        You must deploy this sample application to a physical device.
        <br />
        <br />
        Deployment is the process by which you transfer an application to the target device.&nbsp;
        Before you can deploy your solution, you must package it into a CAB file. A CAB
        file is a type of executable archive file that contains the application, dependencies
        such as DLLs, resources, help files, and any other files you want to include.<br />
        <br />
        A CAB file project, WebBrowserCAB, has been included in the solution so the WebBrowserSample
        application can be easily installed on a physical device.&nbsp; Please build both
        projects and manually copy the resulting WebBrowserCAB.CAB file to the target device
        (not the emulator) using your ActiveSync connection.&nbsp; Tap the CAB file on the
        physical device to install the WebBrowserSample.exe on the PocketPC. Find and run
        WebBrowserSample.exe.&nbsp; (Look under the "Program Files" directory.)<br />
        <br />
        The Splitter Control is viewed on the application as a thin line above the browser.&nbsp;
        Simply tap and drag this line to modify the height of the browser.<br />
        <br />
