            Back Of Pen Erase</h1>
        <p>
            Most digitizer styluses used with Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 have
            an "eraser" at the end opposite the writing side. While there is no direct "eraser"
            API in the Tablet PC Platform SDK, there <em>is</em> a simple way to detect whether
            the stylus is inverted or not. The recommended event associated with reading this
            value is the <strong>CursorInRange </strong>event.
        </p>
        <p>
            This sample shows how to detect and respond to "back of pen" erasing. It also demonstrates
            the two modes of ink deletion: stroke-based and point-based. In the first case,
            the entire stroke over which the eraser passes is deleted. In point-based deletion,
            only the point(s) directly under the eraser are erased.</p>
        <p>
        <b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>

        <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005. </li>
            <li>Microsoft Tablet PC Platform SDK.</li>
