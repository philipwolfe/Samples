            Context Enabled Form</h1>
        <p>
            One of the most powerful uses of Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 is
            for form-related activities. In most cases, this can be done without coding. The
            "Context Tagging Tool" provided with the Tablet PC Platform SDK allows you to specify
            field "masks" for use with <strong>any form-based application</strong>, without
            altering the source code. The Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 searches
            for a specially-formatted XML file when loading an executable; this XML file can
            contain context-sensitive masks or hints for the build-in Tablet Input Panel.</p>
        <p>
            This sample illustrates the context-sensitive capabilities of Microsoft Windows
            XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 explicitly in code. It shows values of the <strong>Factoid
            </strong>type and allows them to be selected. The code explicitly disallows the
            "Word List" factoid, which cannot be programmatically used with the <strong>PenInputPanel
            </strong>type (although it can be used using the Context Tagging Tool). When a factoid
            value is selected, the <strong>PenInputPanel</strong> is used in conjunction with
            a standard <strong>TextBox </strong>control to demonstrate the context hinting.</p>
