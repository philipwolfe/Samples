            Power Awareness</h1>
        <p>
            One of the keys to a highly mobile smart client is awareness of the power status
            of the machine. Certain graphics, file and network operations can be battery-intensive
            and, if possible, a smart client application should be able to alter its behavior
            to accomodate different power situations.</p>
        <p>
            While power-awareness is not part of the .NET 2.0 Base Class Library, it is fairly
            straightforward to read via P/Invoke. This sample provides some power-aware classes
            and enumerations and demonstrates their use; reading the current charging status
            and battery strength.
