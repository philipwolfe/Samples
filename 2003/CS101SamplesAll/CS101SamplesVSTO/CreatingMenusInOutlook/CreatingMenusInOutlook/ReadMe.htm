    <h1>Creating Menus in Outlook</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Outlook supports a rich object model for interacting with mail, contacts, tasks,
        and more.&nbsp; One user interface option is toolbars and menus.&nbsp; Menus, and
        their constituent commands, are easy to add, easy to respond to, and provide a familiar
        interface making it easy for new users to access your functionality.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will create a new menu that appears in the main Outlook menu
        bar, prior to the standard Help menu.&nbsp;
        Adding a menu and commands at design
        or runtime is straight-forward and takes advantage of existing skills regarding
        user interface design.&nbsp; This example adds a static menu command button to display
        the count of items in the Inbox, showing a separate count of unread items.&nbsp;
        A second static menu button allows you to add additional buttons dynamically at
        runtime.&nbsp; Each dynamic button shows its button number as a caption.&nbsp; When
        clicked, a message box appears reflecting the caption.&nbsp; This is implemented
        as a shared event handler.&nbsp; Menu buttons could just as easily be used to display
        settings dialogs, perform database queries, or connect to remote Web services.</p>
