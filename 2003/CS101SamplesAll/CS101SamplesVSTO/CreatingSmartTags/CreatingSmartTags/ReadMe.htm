        Creating Smart Tags</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Smart Tags allow you to create handlers in your documents for recognizing types
        of words, and offering relevant actions based on those words.&nbsp; Microsoft Office
        includes Smart Tag handlers for elements such as postal addresses and names.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you see a Smart Tag that can recognize product ID from the AdventureWorks
        database.&nbsp; This is accomplished using a regular expression that can recognize
        the pattern of XX-XXXX or XX-XXXX-##.&nbsp; If the pattern is detected in a document,
        the ID is underlined, and Smart Tag actions for displaying or inserting the relevant
        product information are available in the context menu.&nbsp; The information is
        retrieved from the AdventureWorks database using a typed dataset.&nbsp; The
        custom Smart Tag also takes advantage of a feature that allows it to find specific
        words in addition to the pattern, in this case, "TEST."&nbsp; Finally, the Recognize
        method is overridden to demonstrate where more advanced recognition could be used.&nbsp;
        In this example, the recognition is simply delegated back to the base class.</p>
    <p>
        As an example, you can try LN-1024 or FR-R92B-58, or any other product ID's from
        the Product table.</p>
