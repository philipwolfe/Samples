        Toolbars provide a convenient
        method of accessing related actions.&nbsp; Microsoft
        Word uses toolbard for file-related actions, review-related actions, drawing-related
        actions, and more.&nbsp; Create your own toolbars to provide shortcuts to your customization
        features.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will create a new toolbar with document-related buttons.&nbsp;
        All buttons are created with captions and corresponding event handlers.&nbsp; The
        actions include performing and displaying a word count, determining the average
        number of
        words per paragraph, and dynamically adding new buttons.&nbsp; Each new
        button simply displays an incrementing number (Button 5, Button 6, etc.).&nbsp;
        Adding buttons at startup, or dynamically is easy and provides an intuitive way
        to present actions to a user.&nbsp; Learning how to add toolbars will make it easier
        to create professional document customizations that fit naturally with the existing
        product.</p>
