    <h1>Integrating Windows Forms into Outlook</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Outlook customizations can extend functionality in many ways.&nbsp; One valuable
        feature is the ability to create Windows form interfaces to present or request information.&nbsp;
        Using Windows forms creates a rich interface with incredible flexibility.&nbsp;
        Rather than being constrained to the Outlook user interface, this allows you to create customizations with the presentation that you desire.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you can see a customization with an add-on menu with one menu command.&nbsp;
        This command displays a Windows form allowing a user to select some basic fields
        to be used to create a new mail message and task.&nbsp;
        A list of contacts is displayed
        in a ComboBox for easy selection, in addition to a text box for a monetary amount,
        a date field, and a free-form message TextBox.&nbsp; The scenario is of a company
        that needs to send delinquent notices to customers.&nbsp; Using a form like this
        can help to enfore consistency, and save time.&nbsp; Mail messages are generated,
        and follow-up tasks are automatically created.&nbsp; It is easy to see how this
        could be extended with database, Web service, or other remote calls to further augment
        the features.</p>
