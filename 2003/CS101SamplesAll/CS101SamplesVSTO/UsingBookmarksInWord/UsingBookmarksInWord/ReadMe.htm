    <h1>Using Bookmarks in Word</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Bookmarks are encapsulations of ranges in Word that allow naming, event handling,
        and in-code manipulation.&nbsp; You can update and retrieve the contents of a Bookmark
        programatically, and users have full control to modify the contents.&nbsp; Use Bookmarks
        as placeholders within a document as opposed to searching and replacing strings
        of text, as in a template.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, a number of Bookmark objects have been added to the document at
        runtime.&nbsp; These fields comprise the first and last name, job title, and email
        address of an Adventure Works employee.&nbsp; The overall document scenario is the
        beginning of an employee review.&nbsp; When the document starts up, the code demonstrates
        adding an additional Bookmark, in this case, for phone number.&nbsp; In addition to the document controls, a user control, EmployeeSelectorUserControl, is created
        to display several fields from a selected row in the vEmployee view of the AdventureWorks
        database.&nbsp; Use the BindingNavigator control to move through the records, then
        click the Select button to update the Bookmark controls with the current employee.&nbsp;
        The design-time Bookmark controls can be updated in-place with the Text property,
        but the run-time instance needs to be re-added to the Bookmarks collection after
        being updated.&nbsp; The C# sample requires several additional steps compared to
        the Visual Basic version due to the COM foundation of the VSTO objects.</p>
