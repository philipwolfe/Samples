    <h1>Using Managed Controls in Excel</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Both Excel and Word support the embedding of Windows form controls directly into
        the document, in addition to full support for displaying stand-alone forms and message
        boxes.&nbsp; You have full access to most of the Windows forms libraries.&nbsp; When you add a managed control to the document surface, an ActiveX control is automatically
        added to host the control, shielding the document itself from any awareness of the
        managed code.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will see a number of Windows forms capabilities exploited in
        a worksheet.&nbsp; Two controls, a Button and a Month Calendar are directly emedded
        into the worksheet.&nbsp; In addition, a standard Windows message box is displayed,
        and a custom Windows form is displayed.&nbsp; The button interacts with a ListObject
        control to add rows of random data.&nbsp; The other elements are based on events
        raised from NamedRange objects embedded in cells.&nbsp; Double-click cell B9 to
        display a message box, right-click cell B12 to display the form, and simply enter
        cell B15 (this selects the cell, raising the Selected event) to display the MonthCalendar
        control.&nbsp; Selecting a date from the calendar inserts the date in short format,
        and returns focus to the cell.&nbsp; Tabbing away, or otherwise deselecting the
        cell causes the MonthCalendar control to be hidden.&nbsp; Such functionality could be extended to cause a calendar to popup near date formatted cells when they are
        entered.&nbsp; Being able to tie into the existing managed controls can bring enormous
        flexibility to your documents with relatively little effort.</p>
