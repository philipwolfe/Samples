        Using the ListObject in Excel</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The ListObject is a key object in Excel.&nbsp; They offer a container for ranges
        that support a header row, automatic total calculation, and dynamic growth as rows
        are added.&nbsp; Built in filtering and sorting rounds out the feature set.&nbsp; Learning about the ListObject provides an important tool in modeling data in a logical
        and intuitive manner for your users.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, the main
        sheet is setup as a simple invoice for the ficticious company,
        Adventure Works.&nbsp; The list of ordered products is implemented as a ListObject.&nbsp;
        In order to add products, a user control, AddProductUserControl is hosted in the
        Document Actions pane.&nbsp; Enter a product number from the Product table, lookup
        the number, then you can insert the number, name, and price
        into the ListObject.&nbsp;
        This uses a strong-typed dataset for the database integration.&nbsp; The logic is
        all contained in the user control, other than the creation and presentation of the
        control in the Startup event of the sheet.&nbsp; You can try out the sample using
        a product number of SA-M198.</p>
