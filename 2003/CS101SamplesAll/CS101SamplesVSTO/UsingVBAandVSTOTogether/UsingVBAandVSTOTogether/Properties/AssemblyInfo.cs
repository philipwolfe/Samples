// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible

// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.

//      Major Version

// The ExcelLocale1033 attribute controls the locale that is passed to the Excel
// object model. Setting ExcelLocale1033 to true causes the Excel object model to 
// act the same in all locales, which matches the behavior of Visual Basic for 
// Applications. Setting ExcelLocale1033 to false causes the Excel object model to
// act differently when users have different locale settings, which matches the 
// behavior of Visual Studio Tools for Office, Version 2003. This can cause unexpected 
// results in locale-sensitive information such as formula names and date formats.
