        Working with InfoPath 2003</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        With the Microsoft InfoPath 2003 Toolkit for Visual Studio 2005 you can now create InfoPath solutions with managed code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample you will learn how to build a fairly simple Adventure Works products
        order form. Some of the functionality you will see is due to built-in InfoPath features,
        and some functionality is via managed code that resides in the FormCode class. The form is built so that the user must first select a product category. These categories are automatically pulled from the AdventureWorks database by the InfoPath
        form when the form loads. The user may then click the Get Products button, which
        displays all of the Adventure Works products for the selected category inside of
        a repeating table that is itself embedded in a scrolling region. This table of products
        is then consulted to fill out the order form by
        entering a Product ID and quantity
        desired. When the user tabs away from the Product ID field, code in the OnAfterChange
        event handler fills in the rest of the values in that row.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> This sample relies on the most recent beta release of the
        InfoPath 2003 Toolkit for Visual Studio 2005.&nbsp; In this release, you will need
        to open Visual Studio, then open the solution from the <strong>File | Open | Project/Solution</strong>
        menu.&nbsp; Double-clicking the solution file will not work.&nbsp; Also, if you
        are prompted that the project is out of date, click Yes to rebuild.&nbsp; These
        issues should not be present in the final release of the InfoPath VSTO support package.</p>
