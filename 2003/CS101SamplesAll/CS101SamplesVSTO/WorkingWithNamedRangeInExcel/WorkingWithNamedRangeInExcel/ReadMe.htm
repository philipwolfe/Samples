        Working with Named Ranges in Excel</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Named ranges allow you to easily reference one or more cells in code.&nbsp; Contained
        named range values can be retrieved, updated or databound.&nbsp; Named ranges expose
        events such as selected/deselected, changed, or double-clicked.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, three named ranges are declared at design time, and one is declared
        at runtime.&nbsp; Each maps to a single cell.&nbsp; If either of two named ranges
        detect changes to their contained value, a Changed event will fire, and a third
        named range value will be set.&nbsp; For this example, salary and debt are keyed
        into cells, and a classification such as low/average/high/extreme is set to a third
        cell.&nbsp; The runtime-declared named range is assigned a simple string value at
        sheet startup.&nbsp; Named ranges make it easier to programmatically manage a worksheet
        similar to labels and textboxes on a Windows form.</p>
