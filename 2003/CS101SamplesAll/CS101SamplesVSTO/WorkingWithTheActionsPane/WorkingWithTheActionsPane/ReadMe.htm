        Working with the ActionsPane</h1>

    <p>
        The Document Actions task pane is a powerful way
        to present controls to a user without
        embedding them directly into a document.&nbsp; Controls appear along the right-side
        of the document window, by default.&nbsp; Microsoft Office includes such pre-built
        actions such as research, clip art, and help, and you can add additional ones relevant
        to your customizations.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will embed three controls in the Document Actions task pane.&nbsp;
        Two will be simple Button objects, while the third cotnrol will be a custom user
        control presenting a product lookup in the Adventure Works database.&nbsp;
        Adding controls to the pane is simple, while responding to control events is as
        straight-forward as Windows forms event handling.&nbsp; The custom control displays a list of products from the Product table, and provides a
        button to insert the product
        information into the current document at the insertion point.&nbsp; This demonstrates
        a custom control, embedding controls into the Document Actions task pane, and inserting
        text into the document in a non-destructive manner.</p>
