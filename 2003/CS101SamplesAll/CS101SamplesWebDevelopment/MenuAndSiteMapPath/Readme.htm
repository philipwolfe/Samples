        <h1>Menus and Sitemaps</h1>

        <p>This sample demonstrates how to use the Menu and SiteMapPath controls in ASP.NET 2.0. The Menu
        control can be used to create a familiar menu system for navigating your Web site, while the SiteMapPath
        control is used to add breadcrumb trail functionality to your web pages. A breadcrumb trail provides
        users of your web site a navigation path based on their current location within the site. Both of
        these controls are very flexible and completely customizable.</p>
        
        <p>There are three examples in this sample. The first example demonstrates how to declaratively build
        a Menu control by adding static and dynamic menu items. The second example shows how to use the Menu
        control for site navigation by binding it to the SiteMapDataSource control. The third example shows
        how to display a breadcrumb trail by using the SiteMapPath control.</p>
        
        <p>This sample requires the following to be installed:</p>
			<ul>
                <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
            </ul>
