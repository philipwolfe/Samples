        <h1>Performing Asynchronous Tasks</h1>
			This sample demonstrates the use of the BackgroundWorker control for performing
			tasks asynchronously, on a background thread. In this sample, successive prime
			numbers are calculated, either synchronously or asynchronously.
			<br>
			<br>
			When calculating synchronously, the UI is locked until the calculation completes,
			as demonstrated by the inability to type into a TextBox control.  However,
			when calculating asynchronously, the UI thread remains free to respond to user
			interaction, and the text box accepts user input. The sample starts with finding the next prime number
        after 100,000 and the larger this starting value, the longer the calculation takes.<br><br>
			This sample requires the following to be installed:	
				<ul>
				<li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
				</ul>
