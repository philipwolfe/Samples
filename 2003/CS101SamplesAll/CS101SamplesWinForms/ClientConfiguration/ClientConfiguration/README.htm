        <h1>Client Configuration</h1>
        
        Visual Studio 2005 introduces a new mechanism for storing and retrieving client configuration settings.
        <br><br>
        The Form contains a TabStrip control and a variety of other controls that are set to values loaded from 
        the user's client configuration settings, whether the default settings (the first time the application runs) 
        or the user's settings store in C:\Documents and Settings\[UserName]\Local Settings\Application Data\ClientConfiguration.
        
        User-scoped settings that are not added programmatically can be persisted. Application-scoped settings and the one 
        dynamically added setting (at the bottom) cannot be persisted.

        Try running the application under different user accounts by right-clicking the EXE and selecting Run As.
        <br><br>
        This sample requires the following to be installed:
			<ul>
        <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
        </ul>
