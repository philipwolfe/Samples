        <h1>Playing Sounds</h1>
        The SoundPlayer is a new Windows Forms component in Visual Studio 2005.
        It is a UI-less component used for playing .wav files and
        system sounds, such as the Exclamation and Beep sounds. Sounds may be played
        asynchronously on a background thread, and they can be looped to repeat endlessly.
        <br><br>
        There are two sections to this sample, both displayed on the same form.
        The first section is used for playing .wav files.  An interface is presented
        for selecting the file to play, and the file may be played synchronously, which
        locks the application until the sound is finished, or asynchronously, for playing 
        long running sounds. Looping is allowed on asynchronous plays.
        <br><br>
        The second section is used to play the supported system sounds. Select
        the sound from the combobox, and click the adjacent Play button.  The specific sound file for each 
        system sound may be configured in the Sounds and Audio Devices control panel applet.
        Not all system sounds are supported by the .NET Framework 2.0.
