    <h1>Using BindingNavigator</h1>
    
    This sample demonstrates the use of the BindingNavigator control for browsing 
    the first one hundred employees in the Adventure Works database. This control
    provides a convenient, VCR-like user interface for navigating through a datasource, such as an ADO.NET
    DataSet.
    <br>
    <br>
    Three tabs are presented, demonstrating three different BindingNavigator control
    instances. The first tab presents a BindingNavigator control created by Visual
    Studio 2005 when you drag a BindingNavigator control from the Toolbox 
    onto the Form.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second tab presents a BindingNavigator control generated dynamically at run
    time, and assigned the standard UI using the addStandardItems parameter to the constructor.
    <br>
    <br>
    The third tab presents a dynamically generated BindingNavigator control, but assigned
    a custom user interface.
    <br>
    <br>
    All three BindingNavigator controls navigate through the same data source.
    <br>
