        <h1>Using the BindingSource Control</h1>
        This sample demonstrates the use of the BindingSource control for 
        browsing the Employees table in the Adventure Works databse.  The BindingSource control
        enables you to bind controls to any of the three types of .NET data sources: 
        a database (which, when added to a project takes the form of a DataSet), an object,
        or a Web service.
        <br><br>
		Three tabs are presented, each demonstrating a different BindingSource control instance.
		The first tab presents a user interface created at design time by dragging and dropping items from 
		the Data Sources window.
		<br><br>
        The second tab displays a similar Form, though built programmatically.  A BindingSource control is 
        created that uses a DataTable of Employee data as its DataSource.  A BindingNavigator is added 
        to provide navigation through the DataTable.
        <br><br>
        The third tab displays a form identical in functionality to that on the second tab, but its 
        BindingSource control uses an object rather than a DataSet as its data source.
        <br><br>
