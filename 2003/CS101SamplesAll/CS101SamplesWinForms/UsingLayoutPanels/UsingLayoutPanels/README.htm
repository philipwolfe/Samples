        <h1>Using Layout Panels</h1>
		This sample demonstrates the use of the TableLayoutPanel and FlowLayoutPanel controls.
		TableLayoutPanel controls lay out contained controls in a grid of five rows and five columns.
		FlowLayoutPanel controls lay out contained controls in the same way a word processor
		lays out text on a document.  The direction the text is flowed, e.g., left to right, or top to bottom,
		and can be specified by the user.
		<br>
		<br>
		This sample displays two tabs.  The first tab contains a TableLayoutPanel control filled with
		various controls, one spanning more than one column.  In addition, a drop-down list is provided for
		specifying the border style surrounding the cells.
		<br>
		<br>
		The second tab contains a FlowLayoutPanel control filled with controls created and arranged at design time.
		A control is provided here for interacting with the FlowLayoutPanel control, to change the 
		flow direction between horizontal and vertical.
		<br>
		<br>
		Resize the form to see how the layout panels resize and rearrange the contained controls.
