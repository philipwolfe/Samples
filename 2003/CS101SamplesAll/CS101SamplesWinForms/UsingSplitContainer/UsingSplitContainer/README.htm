    <h1>Using the SplitContainer</h1>
    
    This sample demonstrates the use of the SplitContainer control. The SplitContainer
    control is a container divided into two panes. A splitter bar is positioned between
    the two panes for controlling the size of each pane, both at design time and at
    run time. The splitter bar can be oriented either vertically or horizontally.
    <br>
    <br>
    This sample is a form with three controls laid out at design time. When the form
    loads at run time, two SplitContainer controls are created dynamically. The first
    SplitContainer control is split vertically, and the second horizontally. The second
    is placed in the right panel of the first, to create a page of three sections--
    a left panel, a top panel, and a main panel--upon which the three design time controls
    are arranged.
