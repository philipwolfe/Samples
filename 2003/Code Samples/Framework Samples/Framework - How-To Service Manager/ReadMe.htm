				.NET Framework: Service Controller</h1>
			<p>
				This sample shows how to control Windows Services under Windows NT, Windows 
				2000, or Windows XP.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				Windows&nbsp;Services are long running programs (analogous to UNIX daemons) 
				that&nbsp;perform task without user interaction. Services are controlled by a 
				system service know as the Service Control Manager (SCM). This sample uses the 
				ServiceController class from the System.ServiceProcess namespace.
			</p>
			<P>Using the UI presented you can Start, Stop, Pause, and Resume a service. The 
				sample checks the current state of the service to see what buttons should be 
				enabled.&nbsp;A timer control runs every 5 seconds by default refreshing the 
				status of all running services. Note that it does not re-enumerate the list of 
				possible services. If you install or uninstall a service while the program is 
				running, you will need the application to re-enumerate the list of possible 
				services. This is accomplished by selecting <STRONG>Relist All Services</STRONG>
				from the Tools menu. The timer can be toggled on &amp; off by checking the <STRONG>Auto 
					Refresh</STRONG> check box. You can manually refresh the status of all 
				services by pressing <STRONG>F5</STRONG> or selecting <STRONG>Refresh</STRONG> from 
				the Tools menu.</P>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater). Services only run on Windows operating systems based upon the Windows 
				NT kernel.
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<p>
				Start&nbsp;the application and it will enumerate all&nbsp;services and show 
				thier status and type. By selecting a different service, the buttons&nbsp;at 
				the bottom of the screen will change their status.&nbsp;Clicking an enabled 
				button will cause it to perform the action requested.
			</p>
			<P>Note that a service can take a few seconds to adjust its state depending upon 
				what it is doing when you request a state change.</P>
