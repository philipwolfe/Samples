				.NET Framework: System Events</h1>
			<p>
				Investigate the SystemEvents class, which allows your applications to react to 
				several events raised by system activity.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				Demonstrates five of the available events of the SystemEvents class. Although 
				there are more events to be tested, this demonstration shows off the events 
				that can easily be tested from a client application.
			</p>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<P>The Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents class provides a number of public events that 
				you can sink in your code. In this example, you can test a few of the events 
				(the ones that are easy to trigger via user interface interaction).
			</P>
			<P>To test the events, try these actions:
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				Handle Screen Changes—Change the screen resolution.
				<LI>
				Handle Time Changes—Modify the current system time.
				<LI>
				Handle Power Mode Changes—If running on a laptop, change the plugged-in status.
				<LI>
					Handle User Preference Changes—Change any Windows setting (For example: 
					right-click on the desktop to display the <EM>Display Properties</EM>
				dialog box and change a setting).
				<LI>
					Handle Installed Font Changes—Occurs when a font is installed or deleted.
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Check the documentation for the SystemEvents class (and the comments in the 
				sample code) for more information.
