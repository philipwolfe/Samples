		How to use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
		<h2>Featured Highlights:</h2>
		<P>
			This How-to shows how to use System.Management to incorporate WMI calls. The 
			application has tabs demonstrating three different uses of WMI:
		</P>
		<P>
			1. WMI Queries. This shows how to use the ManagementObjectSearcher class to 
			query the following system information: Operating System Name, Version, 
			Manufacturer, Computer name, and Windows Directory; Computer System 
			Manufacturer, Model, System Type, and Total Physical Memory; Processor name; 
			Bios version; and Time zone. Queries are created both using the SelectQuery 
			class and by the WQL string version.
		</P>
		<P>
			2. Asynchronous Enumerations. In many cases WMI is used to retrieve large 
			quantities of data. In these situations it is important that the operation is 
			done asynchronously, allowing the user interface, and other ongoing processes 
			to continue. This demonstrates how to get a list of logical drives and their 
			properties asynchronously using the ManagementOperationObserver class, with a 
			callback event.
		</P>
		<P>
			3. WMI Classes. This shows how to enumerate through the top-level WMI classes 
			and all of their subclasses using the ManagementClass and EnumerationOptions 
			classes.
