		<H1>.NET Framework: Reading and Writing to Performance Counters</H1>
		<P>This sample shows some how&nbsp;to read from and write to Performance Counters 
			using Visual Basic.NET. These counters can be used to track the performance of 
			various parts of the operating system and .NET applications.</P>
		<H2>Featured Highlights:</H2>
		<P>This how-to demonstrates how to read from and write to performance counters. 
			Concepts demonstrated are:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Referencing&nbsp;an existing performance counter, and reading its value.
			<LI>
			Creating a custom performance counter that can be written to as well as read 
			from.
			<LI>
				Determining via code whether a performance counter is custom or built-in.</LI></UL>
		<H2>Requirements:</H2>
		<p>Microsoft Visual Studio.NET Professional or greater.<br>
			Windows 2000 or Windows XP.</p>
		<H2>Running the Sample:</H2>
		<P>To run the sample:

		<OL>
			<LI>
				Doubleclick the <STRONG>How-To&nbsp;Reading and Writing to Performance Counters.sln</STRONG>
			file.&nbsp;
			<LI>
				Create a custom performance counter that can be written to. Creating an example 
				counter is outlined below.
				<UL>
					<LI>
						Open the <STRONG>Server Explorer</STRONG>
					<LI>
						Select <STRONG>Servers</STRONG> -&gt; <EM>your computer name</EM> -&gt; <STRONG>Performance 
							Counters</STRONG>
					<LI>
						Right click <STRONG>Performance Counters</STRONG> and select "<STRONG>Create New 
							Category...</STRONG>"
					<LI>
						In the dialog box, enter "<STRONG> How-To Performance</STRONG> <STRONG>Counters</STRONG>" 
					as the Category Name, and any description you would like in the Category 
					Description text box.
					<LI>
					Click "New" to add a new Performance Counter.
					<LI>
						Enter "<STRONG>My First Custom Counter</STRONG>" as the <STRONG>Name</STRONG>, 
						"<STRONG>NumberOfItems32</STRONG>" as the <STRONG>Type</STRONG>, and any 
						description you would like as the <STRONG>Counter Description</STRONG>.
					<LI>
						Run the project, or press the "Refresh" button if it is already running.</LI></UL>
			<LI>
			Explore&nbsp;selecting and reading from&nbsp;the built-in performance counters.
			<LI>
			Select the custom performance counter you build earlier. Select it by Category 
			and Counter, then use the increment and decrement buttons to increment and 
			decrement the value.
			<LI>
				Explore Performance Counters further by creating more custom performance 
				counters of other types, including "<STRONG>RateOfCountsPerSecond32</STRONG>" 
				which measures the number of increments that occur in running one-second 
				intervals.
