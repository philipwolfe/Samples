				Security: Role-based security</h1>
			<p>
				This sample will show you how to retrieve login &amp; group membership for 
				Windows users of your application. This allows the application to enable 
				application features(controls for example) based upon a user's identity. In 
				addition,&nbsp;it will show&nbsp;how to make&nbsp;role-based security demands 
				via code.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				The main form has a tab control with two pages. The first tab page retrieves 
				user login information to create a WindowsPrincipal object. The properties of 
				the WindowsIdentity are displayed. The code uses the IsInRole method to check 
				the CheckBox controls based on group membership. The second tab page contains 
				Button controls that execute code to open a secured form based on security 
				demands. If the user is a member of the Windows group, the protected form 
				opens. If a security exception occurs as a result of the user not being a 
				member of the group, a message is displayed.
			</p>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<P>When you click the button, <SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
					Retrieve </SPAN>User Information, the program checks for the current logged 
				in user to see if she is a member of four groups:
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				Administrators
				<LI>
				Power Users
				<LI>
				Users
				<LI>
					Managers</LI></UL>
			<P>The group Managers is a custom group which you will need to create. If the user 
				is not a member of a requested group the checkbox next to the group name will 
				not be checked. In addition, if the custom group Managers does not exist, the 
				check box will also not be checked. Note that an exception will not occur if 
				the group is not there.</P>
			<P>If you make changes to your current group membership in Windows in order to test 
				the code (such as by creating a Managers group and adding your account to it), 
				then you will need to log off and log on again before those changes will take 
				effect.</P>
