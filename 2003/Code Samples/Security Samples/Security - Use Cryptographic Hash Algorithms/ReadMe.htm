		<h1>Security: How to Use Cryptographic Hash Algorithms</h1>
		<p>Hash values (digests) are unique and extremely compact numerical representations 
			of a piece of data. Changing even one character in a source file can result in 
			huge differences in the hash value. Hashes are used to ensure data integrity. 
			For example, by comparing the hash value generated before a message is sent 
			with the hash value generated from the received text,&nbsp;the recipient can 
			determine whether the message has been corrupted. This application demonstrates 
			how to use hash functions for this purpose.</p>
		<h2>Featured Highlights:</h2>
		<p>Scenario: The fictitious Northwind Corporation wants to send a highly 
			confidential listing of its products and prices to you for marketing overseas. 
			The data is transmitted over a secure connection, but both parties want 
			additional measures taken to ensure that the listing is not corrupted in 
			transit.</p>
		<P>When you run this application, an XML data document of all the Northwind 
			products is created by querying the SQL Server Northwind database and 
			persisting the DataSet to XML. This simulates the sender creating the source 
			document. The contents of this document&nbsp;are then&nbsp;read into a 
			StreamReader and converted to a string to display in&nbsp;a TextBox. This 
			simulates&nbsp;you receiving the transmitted document.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>Additionally, when the Form is&nbsp;loaded an MD5&nbsp;hash digest is created to 
			use as an original "key" by which you can validate the transmitted XML. Click 
			the Compare! button to compare the hash digest for the products "sent over the 
			wire" (displayed) with the hash digest sent from Northwind. Alter the contents 
			of the TextBox and click Compare! to see the results.</P>
		<P>Examples of three different hash types are provided: MD5, SHA1, and SHA384.</P>
		<h2>Requirements:</h2>
		<P>This application requires the release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional 
			(or greater) and access to the Northwind database residing in SQL Server or the 
			Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE). To install MSDE, do the following:</P>
		<P><STRONG>1. </STRONG>Open the Start menu, click Programs, click Microsoft .NET 
			Framework SDK, and then click Samples and Quickstart Tutorials.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>2. </STRONG>Click "Step 1: Install the .NET Framework Samples Database".
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>3. </STRONG>Open a command window, and CD to
			<FRAMEWORKSDK>\Samples\Setup This is typically : C:\Program Files\Microsoft 
			Visual Studio .NET\FrameworkSDK\Samples\Setup
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>4. </STRONG>Type: osql -E -S (local)\NetSDK -i InstNwnd.sql
			<h2>Running the Sample:</h2>
		<p>Simply press <STRONG>F5</STRONG>.
