	<p class="vseval">The Code and Text Editor is a word processing utility where you enter, display, and edit code or text. It is referred to as either the Text Editor or the Code Editor, based on its content. If it contains only text without an associated language, it is referred to as the Text Editor. If it contains source code associated with a language, it is referred to as the Code Editor. Because it is most often used for editing code, though, we will refer to it as the Code Editor.</p>
