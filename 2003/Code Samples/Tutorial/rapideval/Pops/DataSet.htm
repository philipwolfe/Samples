	<p class="vseval">ADO.NET is an evolution of the ADO data access model. It was designed specifically for the web with scalability, statelessness, and XML in mind.</p>
	<p class="vseval">ADO.NET uses some familiar ADO objects, such as the Connection and Command objects, and also introduces new objects. Key new ADO.NET objects include the DataSet, DataReader, and DataAdapter.</p>	
	<p class="vseval">The important distinction between ADO.NET and ADO is that there exists an object -- the DataSet -- that is separate and distinct from any data stores. Because of that, the DataSet functions as a standalone entity. You can think of the DataSet as an always disconnected recordset that knows nothing about the source or destination of the data it contains. Inside a DataSet, much like in a database, there are tables, columns, relationships, constraints, views, and so forth.</p>
