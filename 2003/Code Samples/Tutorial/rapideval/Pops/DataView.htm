	<p class="vseval">After a dataset has been populated, your application might need to view its data in various ways. For example, you might want to view the records in a specific order or see only a subset of the records (that is, filter them). Because the dataset is disconnected from the data source, it is often impractical and resource-intensive to re-execute SQL commands to perform these actions. Instead, you can use built-in dataset features to filter and sort, the data view. A data view is an object that acts as a layer on top of the data table, providing a filtered and sorted view of the table's contents. A data view is similar to a view in a database, in that it is not a copy of the data. Instead, it is simply a different way of seeing the data in a table.</p>
