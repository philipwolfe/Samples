    <p>The .NET Framework includes cutting edge technology that allows a Windows 
Forms application to run directly from a network share or web site as long as 
you have the .NET Framework installed.  By default, code available on the 
internet should not be trusted as much as code developed by someone known to you 
or your organization.  As a result, default security settings will run code from 
the Internet Zone under a special security context that does not have the same 
privileges that an application installed on your hard drive would have.</p>
<p>To see this technology in action, click the <b>Run Sample</b> link at the bottom 
of this page.  After approximately 5-15 seconds you should see the sample 
application with a security warning like in the screenshot below.  This warning 
is normal and is .NET's way of warning you that the application running from the 
Internet Zone has restricted permissions.</p>

	<p>Due to your local security or proxy settings, your system settings may not allow 
this application to run from the Web, in which case you will receive an error 
message instead of the screen above.  If this happens, you can still run the 
sample by right-clicking the Run Sample link, saving the executable to your 
local hard drive, then double-clicking the executable to run the sample.</p>
