				Web Service: Transfer Binary Data via HTTP</h1>
			<p>
				This sample is designed to show how to transfer binary data (images in this 
				case) over a web service.
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<P>The sample contains two solutions:
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				VB.NET How-To Web Service Graphics (in the Client folder)&nbsp;
				<LI>
					GraphicsServer (in the WebService folder)</LI></UL>
			<P>Each solution has one project.
			</P>
			<P><EM>Please see the individual ReadMe.htm files for each solution.</EM></P>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<P>Because this example involves both a Windows client application and a Web 
				Service application, its installation is a bit trickier than most samples. The 
				client application, VB.NET How-To Web Service Graphics, includes&nbsp;a Web 
				Reference to the Web Service exposed by the GraphicsServer project. Your goal 
				is to create a new virtual directory named <STRONG>VB.NETHowToGraphicsServer</STRONG>
				that "points" to the WebService folder that was created when you installed this 
				example.
			</P>
			<P>In order to create the necessary IIS (Internet Information Server) project, 
				follow these steps:</P>
			<OL>
				<LI>
				From the Windows Control Panel, Administrative Tools menu, select Internet 
				Information Services.
				<LI>
				Within the Internet Information Services applet, expand nodes in the treeview 
				panel on the left, expanding Internet Information Services, your local 
				computer, Web Sites, then Default Web Site.
				<LI>
				Right-click on Default Web Site, and select New, then Virtual Directory. Click 
				Next to bypass the Welcome page.
				<LI>
					In the Virtual Directory Alias page, enter <STRONG>VB.NETHowToGraphicsServer</STRONG>. 
				Click Next.
				<LI>
				In the Web Site Content Directory page, browse to the WebService folder within 
				the sample you've installed, and select the WebService folder. Click Next.
				<LI>
				In the Access Permissions page, click Next to accept the default settings.
				<LI>
					Click Finish to complete the wizard.</LI></OL>
			<P>Once you've added the new virtual directory, you should be able to load 
				the&nbsp; <STRONG>VB.NET How-To Web Service Graphics.sln</STRONG> file, in the 
				Client folder, and then load and run the sample.</P>
