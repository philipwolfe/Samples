		<h1>Windows Forms : Use Drag-and-Drop</h1>
		<p>
			This demonstration shows you how to implement drag and drop functionality in a 
			Windows Form. Drag-and-drop is one of the fundamental metaphors underlying the 
			Microsoft® Windows® family of operating systems. Users understand that some 
			items can be moved around by holding the mouse down on them, and that they'll 
			get appropriate visual feedback when they're over a spot where the item can be 
			dropped. They expect to be able to move data and images from one spot to 
			another this way. .NET makes it easy to implement drag-and-drop in your own 
			applications. You can control all aspects of the process, including which 
			controls allow dragging, what data they make available to drag, and where it 
			can be dropped. You can implement this both within a single application and 
			between applications. In this How To, you'll learn how to manage drag-and-drop 
			in .NET.
		</p>
		<h2>Featured Highlights:</h2>
		<P>This application has three examples of drag and drop:
		</P>
		<P>a) From a TextBox control to two other TextBox controls, one of which does not 
			have the AllowDrop property set to True, demonstrating how to prevent a drop on 
			a control.
		</P>
		<P>b) From a TreeView control to another TreeView control, demonstrating how to 
			move nodes from one to the other.
		</P>
		<P>c) From a PictureBox to another PictureBox, demonstrating how to copy images 
			from one to the other.
		</P>
		<P>You can do a Copy or a Move when you drag and drop. To copy, hold down the Ctrl 
			key while dragging. When you do this notice the Copy-Drop symbol (rectangle 
			with + sign). The Move symbol is just the rectangle.
		</P>
		<H2>Requirements:</H2>
		<P>Microsoft Visual Studio.NET Professional or greater.<br>
			Windows 2000 or Windows XP</P>
		<h2>Running the Sample:</h2>
		<P>There are no special instructions for running the sample. However, consider the 
			following when coding drag-and-drop operations:</P>
		<P>1. In Version 1.0 of Visual Studio .NET there is no way to set the AllowDrop 
			property of the PictureBox using the Forms designer. Currently you have to set 
			this property directly in the code.
		</P>
		<P>2. The data to be dragged should be an instance of the String, Bitmap, or 
			MetaFile class, or an object that implements the ISerializable or IDataObject 
			interfaces.
		</P>
