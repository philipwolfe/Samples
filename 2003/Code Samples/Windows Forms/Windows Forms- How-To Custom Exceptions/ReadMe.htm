				WinForms: Custom Exceptions &amp; Global Exception Handlers</h1>
			<p>
				This solution demonstrates two more advanced exception mangement 
				techniques.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
			<p>
				This sample contains two projects:&nbsp;a Windows Forms client and a Class 
				Library.
			</p>
			<P><STRONG>Class Library</STRONG></P>
			<P>The class library defines one application class, Customer. In addition it 
				exposes a set of custom exception class which are used to expose application 
				defined errors. Unlike previous versions of Visual Basic (and COM which it was 
				based upon), .NET Exceptions are fully typed removing the need for error 
				numbers. While you can still have error numbers, it is much better to defined 
				application exceptions which can expose a much richer array of information to 
				the caller. In this application there is a hierarchy of exceptions. At the top 
				is CRMSystemException for the fictitious SomeCompany CRM system. It inherits 
				from System.Application exception (as opposed to System.SystemException which 
				is used by Microsoft). From there, two classes inherit from it:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				CustomerException
				<LI>
					EmployeeException</LI></UL>
			<P>There is nothing in this sample related to employees, but we wanted to show how 
				you can have a larger product that could be made up of various modules or 
				components. There then two more exceptions which both inherit 
				from&nbsp;CustomerException:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				CustomerNotFoundException
				<LI>
					CustomerNotDeletedException</LI></UL>
			<P>Each class exposes different levels of information and functionality. Examine 
				the source code for more comments. Note that your exceptions classes can be 
				named anything, but by convention they should end with the suffix Exception.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Client</STRONG></P>
			<P>The client application has a reference to the class library. Two command buttons 
				show how to execute methods against the customer class and catch the custom 
				exceptions. A third command button causes an unhandled exception. In addition, 
				there is a check box labeled 'Turn on Global Exception Trap' which when checked 
				enabled a global exception trap. When enabled, the code defined 
				in&nbsp;OnThreadException will be executed instead of the default Windows Form 
				handler. Please see the comments for more information.</P>
			<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<p>
				Requires the Trial or Release version of Visual Studio .NET Professional (or 
				greater).
			</p>
			<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
			<p>
				The program is best run&nbsp;outside the debugger to see the effects of a 
				global exception handler. Run the program and click&nbsp;all three buttons. 
				Note how Edit Customer and Delete Customer display nice&nbsp;error dialogs. 
				Note that by default if you click the third button labeled Untrapped Local 
				Error, a custom dialog appears. This dialog is the global exception handler 
				defined by Windows Forms. Check the check box labeled 'Turn on Global Exception 
				Trap' to see a custom trap in action.
