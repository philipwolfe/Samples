        <h1>Access Control List (ACL) Sample</h1>
        .Net 2.0 now includes the System.Security.AccessControl namespace that provides a way to create and modify an ACL. 
        New members using the ACL have also been added to I/O, registry and Threading classes.
        <p></p>
        File security is accessed via the FileSecurity class. This class provides methods to enumerate the current access and audit rules for the file,
        and retrieve the owner and group information. Using this object you can also add, change and remove access and audit rules as well as change the
        owner of the file.       
        <p></p>
        In this example, you use the FileSecurity class to read the various rules for a given file. You can then add or remove rules, settings
        the file access rights for a given user. Audit rules cannot be set with this sample.
        <p></p>
        <b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
        <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005.</li>
	    </ul>
