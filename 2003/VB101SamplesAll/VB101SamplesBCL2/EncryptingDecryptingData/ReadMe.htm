        Encrypting and Decrypting Data
    </h1>
    This sample demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt data, using both Symmetric and
    Asymmetric algorithms.<br />
    <br />
    Symmetric encryption requires that the sender and the recipient both have the same
    key for encrypting and decrypting the data. The sender must therefore provide this
    shared key to the recipient safely, to avoid the possibility of the key being intercepted
    and used by others to decrypt the supposedly secret data. One means of securing
    the shared key is to encrypt it with asymmetric encryption, which uses a public
    and private key pair for encryption and decryption.<br />
    <br />
    Symmetric encryption is several times faster than asymmetric, and thus is suitable
    for large quantities of data. Asymmetric encryption can be considered more secure
    because it does not require a shared key. To get the best of both worlds, you will
    typically encrypt data symmetrically, then encrypt the shared key asymmetrically
    before sending it to the recipient. When you encrypt the symmetric key and vector
    using the recipient's public key, only the recipient can decrypt them using his/her
    private key, which is unknown to anyone else.<br />
