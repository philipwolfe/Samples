            Using SecureString</h1>
        The new SecureString class provides a secure alternative to System.String by providing
        a pinned, encrypted and mutable string that helps secure private string data within
        an application.<br />
        <p></p>
        In this example we focus on how to add data to a SecureString and how to read data
        contained in a SecureString using the provided API.&nbsp; A password TextBox control
        is used to add one character at a time into the SecureString using the AppendChar
        method.&nbsp; For best results, type the password slowly so each character can be
        read and inserted into the SecureString properly.&nbsp; In addtion, this example
        demonstrates how to make a SecureString read only by clicking the Login Button and
        how to retrieve the value of the SecureString via the Marshal class by clicking
        the Verify Button.&nbsp; See the code for additional comments.<p></p>
