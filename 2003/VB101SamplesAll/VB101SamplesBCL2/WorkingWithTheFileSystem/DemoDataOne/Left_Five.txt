Unlike many other operating systems, Windows uses a drive letter
abstraction at the user level to distinguish one disk or partition from
another. For example, the path C:\WINDOWS\ represents a directory
WINDOWS on the partition represented by the letter C. The C drive is
most commonly used for the primary hard disk partition, on which
Windows is installed and from which it boots.

This "tradition" has become so firmly ingrained that bugs came about in
older versions of Windows which made assumptions that the drive that
the operating system was installed on was C. The tradition of using "C"
for the drive letter can be traced to MS-DOS, where the letters A and B
were reserved for up to two floppy disk drives; in a common
configuration, A would be the 3½-inch floppy drive, and B the 5¼-inch
one. Network drives may also be mapped to drive letters.

Since Windows interacts with the user via a graphical user interface,
its documentation refers to directories as a folder which contains
files, and is represented graphically with a folder icon.
