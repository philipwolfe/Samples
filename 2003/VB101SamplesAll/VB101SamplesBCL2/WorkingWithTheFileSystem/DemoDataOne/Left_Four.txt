Microsoft Windows developed out of an earlier operating system (MS-DOS
which in turn was based on CP/M-80, which took many ideas from still
earlier operating systems, notably several from DEC), and has added
both file system and user interface ideas from several other sources
since its first release (Unix, OS/2, etc). As such, Windows makes use
of the File Allocation Table and NTFS filesystems. Older versions of
the FAT file system had file name length limits, plus had restrictions
on the maximum size of FAT-formatted disks or partitions.

NTFS, introduced with the Windows NT operating system, allowed ACL-
based permission control. Hard links, multiple file streams, attribute
indexing, quota tracking, compression and mount-points for other file
systems (called "junctions") are also supported, though not all well
documented.
