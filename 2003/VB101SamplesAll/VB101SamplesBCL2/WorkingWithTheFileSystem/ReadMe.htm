        Working With the File System
    </h1>
    This sample demonstrates how to use the file system to manage and manipulate files.<br />
    <br />
    The File class provides a variety of methods for manipulating files, including Create,
    Copy, Move, Delete and more. These methods are all static (C#) or shared (VB), which
    means that you can invoke them without creating an instance of the class.<br />
    <br />
    The FileInfo class provides similar methods, but they are instance methods, which
    means you must create an instance of the class before you can use them. FileInfo
    includes properties such as Length, CreationTime, and LastWriteTime that are not
    available in the File class.<br />
    <br />
    For manipulating folders, you can use the Directory and DirectoryInfo classes. They
    are very similar to the File and FileInfo classes, in that Directory offers static/shared
    methods, while DirectoryInfo offers instance methods.<br />
    <br />
