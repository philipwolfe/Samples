        <h1>Functionality shown in this sample:</h1>
        <p></p>
        With ADO.NET 2.0, you see that the DataSet object and the DataReader objects still exist. There is still
        a significant advantage in regards to performance with the DataReader object.  The DataReader object is
        still a very fast forward-only, read-only object. 
        <p></p>
        Conversely, with the a DataSet, although you have lesser performance as compared to the DataReader, you have more flexibility. The DataSet object is a multi-purpose object that is bi-directional, meaning you can scroll forward and backward
        through the data that is returned.  As well, the DataSet object allows you add rows and have them persist back to the
        database.
        <p></p>
        In this example, you can return either strings or integers and display them in a DataGridView.  First, you select how many rows you want
        to display in the DataGridView.  Then, you select whether you want the data to be 
        stored in a DataReader object or a DataSet object. You then click the Run Test button and view the Test Results
        to see the difference in performance between the two storage objects.
