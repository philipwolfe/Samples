        <h1>SqlBulkCopy sample</h1>
        With SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, you can now perform bulk inserts by using the new SqlBulkCopy class.
        With this class you can move data between servers easily with only a few lines of code.  You can also use the SqlRowsCopied Event
        to indicate to the user when a certain level of progress has been achieved.
        
        <p></p>
        In this example, you will first choose how many rows you want to populate your table with.  After your selection has been made,
        you click the Fill Data button to insert the data into the first table.
        After this has completed, click the Copy Data button to copy the data from
        the first table to another table.  During the copying process you will see an updating status bar showing you the current 
        status of the copying and when it is complete, it will show you the performance results in the Test Results
        area.
        <p></p>
