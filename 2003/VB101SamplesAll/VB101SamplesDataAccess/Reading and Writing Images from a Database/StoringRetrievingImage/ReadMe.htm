        <h1>Reading and Writing Images from a Database</h1>
        With ADO.NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005, you can now store image data in your database using the image data type.
        <p></p>
        Previously, to store image data, you had to store it as as BLOB.  There were size and performance considerations 
        when this technique was used. Now, with the image data type, this storage has been better optimized.
        <p></p>
        In this example, you will insert and retrieve image data into a database.  You can browse for images located on your
        local machine, add a name to your photograph and then click Insert New Image to upload the new image.  Each image can also
        be assigned to a specific category.  After you upload your images, you can retrieve your images by category and scroll through the images
        that are stored in that category.
