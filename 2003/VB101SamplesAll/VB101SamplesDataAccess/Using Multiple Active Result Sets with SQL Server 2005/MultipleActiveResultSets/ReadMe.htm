        <h1>MARS Sample</h1>
        With SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, you can return multiple result sets using only one connection.
        When creating a new connection string, MultipleActiveResultSets is true by default.  By setting MultipleActiveResultSets to false
        you need to open multiple connections to return data.  By setting MultipleActiveResultSets to true, you need only one
        connection to return multiple result sets.
        
        <p></p>
        This example shows you how to return Employee data with their associated Address data.
        In the RichTextBox, you will see the Employee data and the associated Address data.
        <p></p>
        In this example, first select how you want to return data and then click Retrieve Data.  
        In the Test Results box, you will see how much time elapsed to return the data by 
        each method and how many connections were required.
        <p></p>
