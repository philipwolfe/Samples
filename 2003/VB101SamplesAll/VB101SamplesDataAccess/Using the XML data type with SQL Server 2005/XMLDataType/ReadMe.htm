            XML DataType Sample</h1>
        <p></p>
        With SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, XML data has been upgraded to a first-class data type.  SQL Server 2005 treats XML data natively similar to an Integer or Double data type.
        With Visual Studio 2005, you can access these data types by using the new XmlReader to retrieve XML data from a database and iterate through this data with only a few lines of code. 
        <p></p>
        In this example, you insert data into a database from an XML file and then you can view the data as it is retrieved from the database.  You first select a category for which you want to 
        insert data.  Then, you click the Insert Data button.  After the data has been inserted, you can view the table definition by clicking the View Table Definition button.  
        Finally, you can view the actual data stored in the database by clicking the View Data button.
        <p></p>
