<h1>Data Centric Application</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates how to create a simple data centric application by binding TextBox controls to a DataSet.  For this sample, a sample xml file is created when the form is created.  This xml file, "\My Documents\Personal\Persons.xml", is read into a DataSet using the XmlTextReader.  Once the data is in the DataSet, the TextBox controls can be bound to this data with the use of the DataBindings property.  Use the Next button to move to the next row in the DataSet and see how the position of a BindingContext may be changed to display the next record.

<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
<ul>
