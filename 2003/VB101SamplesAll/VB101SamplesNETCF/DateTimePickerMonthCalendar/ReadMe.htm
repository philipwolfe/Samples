        <h1>DateTimePicker and MonthCalendar Sample</h1>
		The new .NET Compact Framework adds two new controls which provide graphical selection of dates and times.  These two new controls, DateTimePicker and MonthCalendar, are demonstrated in this sample on separate tabs labeled DateTimePicker and MonthCalendar respectively.  
		<p></p>
		The DateTimePicker tab demonstrates how a DateTimePicker can function as a date picker as well as a time picker by setting the ShowUpDown property of the DateTimePicker.  If the ShowUpDown property is true, then the DateTimePicker can be viewed as a time picker.  In this sample notice how the time picker utilizes the properties 'Format' and 'CustomFormat' to provide a customized display format value 'h:mm tt' for selecting time while the date picker sets the 'Format' property to 'Long' and leaves the 'CustomFilter' property value blank.
		<p></p>
		The MonthCalendar tab demonstrates some characteristics of the MonthCalendar that may be set at either design or run time.  Notice how you can change the 'ShowToday' and ShowTodayCircle' properties to control how today's date is displayed on the MonthControl.  Note also how the 'FirstDayOfWeek' property may be modified to alter the first day of the week displayed on the MonthCalendar.
