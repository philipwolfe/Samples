<h1>DocumentList</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use. Accessing files in a Pocket PC application is made easier with the DocumentList control, which provides file navigation and manipulation operations directly in the application.
<p></p>
In earlier versions of the .NET CF you had to use the SaveFileDialog and OpenFileDialog controls to provide the same services that are now encapsulated in the DocumentList control. SaveFileDialog and OpenFileDialog are still supported in .NET CF 2.0; and they remain appropriate for numerous application scenarios. However, the DocumentList control solves a unique user interface challenge for Pocket PC users by providing additional functionality directly within a single form. This reduces the amount of user interaction required to do basic file operations such as copying, deleting, renaming and moving, thus increasing application performance by removing the need to load multiple forms.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the filtering and selection functionality of the DocumentList control in addition to other attributes.  In order to increase usefulness, this sample creates three text files and three xml files and places them in the "\My Documents\Personal" folder.  These files may be deleted using the "File|Delete Sample Files" MainMenu item or created again using the "File|Create Sample Files" MainMenu item.  Note how the various events of the DocumentList can be used to respond to actions such as deleting a file or selecting a file in the list.

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.</li>
