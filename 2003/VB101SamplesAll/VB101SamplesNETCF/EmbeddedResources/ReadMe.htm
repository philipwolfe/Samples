<h1>
    Embedded Resources</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 make it easier to
        create smart device applications.
<p></p>
        Resources such as files and images may be embedded into the assembly and accessed at run time from the assembly.&nbsp; A couple of notes to ensure you embed your
        desired resources correctly.&nbsp;
        <br />
        <br />
        First, add the desired resource to the project--in our case a .bmp image file.<br />
        <br />
        Second, set the Build Action property of the resource to 'Embedded Resource.'&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        Third, when&nbsp; referencing the resource in code, be sure and remember to include
        the namespace in the resource name when calling the GetManifestResourceStream method.&nbsp;
        The namespace for this project is 'EmbeddedResources' which is the name of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
        if resources
        are placed in a subdirectory under the project root directory such as 'Images,'
        then the correct call to the GetManifestResourceStream method would be something
        like this: GetManifestResourceStream("EmbeddedResources.Images.Gone Fishing.bmp")<br />
        <br />
        This sample uses an embedded resource image to set the background of the form and
        embedded resource images to load the thumbnail PictureBox controls.&nbsp; Clicking
        on a thumbnail image will display this image in the MainPictureBox.<br />
        <br />
<p></p>
<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.</li>
</ul>
