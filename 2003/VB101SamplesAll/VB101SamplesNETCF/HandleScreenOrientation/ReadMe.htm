<h1>Handling Screen Orientation</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates how to handle changes to the screen orientation.
<p></p>
The screen orientation can be changed by setting the SystemSettings.ScreenOrientation property of the form.  In this example the screen can be set to portrait (Angle0) or landscape (Angle90).  With the new Anchor and Dock features of the .NET CF 2.0 release it becomes easy to ensure that your form will be properly displayed in landscape mode as well as the standard portrait mode. In the rare case where the Anchor and Dock properties are insufficient, custom positioning can be implemented intelligently.  Note how the TextBox2.Height property can be calculated to use all available screen area in this sample using the Form's ClientRectangle.Height property to determine the available screen area.
<p></p>
<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.</li>
</ul>
