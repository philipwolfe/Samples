<h1>HardwareButton and Screen Orientation</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 introduces a number of controls for building smart devices applications that deliver more features and are easier for consumers to use.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the HardwareButton controls as well as how to change the screen orientation.
<p></p>
The screen orientation can be changed by setting the SystemSettings.ScreenOrientation property of the form to one of four values as defined by the ScreenOrientation enumeration.  This sample allows the user to rotate the screen orientation clockwise or counter clockwise with either the labeled buttons or with the left or right hardware rocker keys on the emulator or device.
<p></p>
There are six hardare keys defined in the HardwareKeys enumeration.  Not all emulators or devices support all these keys.  For this reason, this sample allows the user to click every hardware key and see in the status bar what key was pressed.
<p></p>        
<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.</li>
</ul>
