<h1>
    Using MSMQ</h1>
<p></p>
The .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 make it easier to
        deploy smart device applications.
<p></p>
This sample demonstrates the new support for the Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ)
        in the .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) 2.0.<br />
        <br />
        In order to use MSMQ on a device or with the VS 2005 emulator, the following files
        from the SDK must be present in the windows subdirectory: msmqadm.exe, msmqadmext.dll,
        msmqd.dll and msmqrt.dll.&nbsp; These four files are added to the project with the
        "Build Action" property set to "Content" and the "Copy To Output" property set to
        "Copy Always."&nbsp; The first time this sample is run, the files are copied to
        the windows directory and the MSMQ is initialized using the msmqadm utility through
        a CreateProcess call to the CoreDll.dll.<br />
        <br />
        This sample demonstrates saving and retrieving strings to the queue.&nbsp;
        Simply add string messages to the queue by typing text in the TextBox and clicking the
        "Send" button.&nbsp; Click the "Receive" button to get the available messages from
        the queue and display them in the ListBox.<br />
        <br />

<b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
