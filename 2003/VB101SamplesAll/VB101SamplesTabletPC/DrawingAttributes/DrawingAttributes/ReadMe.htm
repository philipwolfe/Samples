            Controlling Drawing Attributes</h1>
        <p>
        The Microsoft Tablet PC Platform SDK provides complete control over the visual style
            of drawn ink. Attributes include the obvious, like color and height and width of
            the "pen tip", and less obvious, such as transparency, raster operations, pressure
            sensitivity, and "pen tip" shape. This sample demonstrates the most common way of
            manipulate these values, by setting the <strong>DefaultDrawingAttributes </strong>
            property of an <strong>InkOverlay </strong>object.</p>
        <p>
        <b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
        </p>
        <ul>
