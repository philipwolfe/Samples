            Recognizing Gestures</h1>
        <p>
        The Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 provides system-level recognition
            of various traced gestures, ranging from basic geometric shapes (square, circle,
            triangle, etc.) to proof-reading symbols such as curlicues and chevrons. Gesture
            recognition can be turned on or off, and fine-tuned using the <strong>SetGestureStatus()
            </strong>method of the <strong>InkOverlay </strong>class.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            This samples enumerates all of the system gestures and populates a <strong>CheckedListBox
            </strong>with their names. As gestures are checked and unchecked, listening for
            them is turned on or off. There is some additional processing to handle the special
            gestures "AllGestures" and "NoGestures" commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Gesture </strong>event is fired by the <strong>InkOverlay</strong> as
            appropriate. The associated event arguments contain an array of <strong>Gesture</strong>s
            with their <strong>ID</strong>s and <strong>Confidence </strong>levels. N.B.: <strong>
                NoGesture</strong> is often passed with a higher <strong>Confidence </strong>
            than the hoped-for gesture, so it's important to use a loop similar to what is shown
            in this sample to iterate over the passed-in <strong>Gesture</strong>s and confirm
            that the hoped-for gesture has, in fact, a higher confidence.</p>
        <p>
            The array of returned <strong>Gesture</strong>s is displayed in a <strong>Label</strong>.
