        <h1>
            Ink-Enabled TextBox</h1>
        <p>
        The Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 provides the Pen Input Panel (PIP)
            that automatically provides for text input using either freeform handwriting, character-by-character
            recognition, or a "tap"-able QWERTY keyboard. This is the simplest and often the
            best solution for text entry in a Tablet application.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Controls</strong> that support the Text Framework Services additionally provide the ability to correct mis-recognitions on a word-by-word basis after the
            initial recognition. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it is a straightforward matter to use an <strong>InkOverlay</strong> in
            conjunction with a <strong>Timer </strong>and the handwriting recognition APIs to
            create a customized ink-enabled <strong>TextBox</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This sample demonstrates these three different options. First, a simple <strong>TextBox
            </strong>is used in which data is entered via the PIP. Second, the TFS capabilities of a <strong>RichTextBox</strong> are available: after entering text with the PIP,
            select a word and the PIP will reappear with alternates for that word available.</p>
        <p>
            Finally, a <strong>TextBox</strong>, <strong>InkOverlay</strong>, and <strong>Timer
            </strong>are used to allow ink-gathering on the <strong>TextBox</strong>'s surface.
            After the <strong>Timer</strong>'s <strong>Interval </strong>expires with no new
            <strong>Stroke</strong>s added, the ink is recognized and the text is placed in
            the <strong>TextBox</strong>.</p>
