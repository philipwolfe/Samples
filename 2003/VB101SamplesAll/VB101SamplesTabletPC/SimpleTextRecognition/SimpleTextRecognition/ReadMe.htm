            Simple Text Recognition</h1>
        <p>
        The Microsoft Tablet PC Platform SDK provides text recognition capabilities in the
            <strong>Microsoft.Ink </strong>namespace. Text recognition is performed by <strong>RecognitionContext
            </strong>which are produced by an instance of type <strong>Recognizer</strong>.
            Multiple <strong>Recognizers</strong> may (and probably will) be installed on a
            single machine. Often, you will want to use the default recognizer, which can be
            retrieved with the <strong>GetDefaultRecognizer() </strong>method of the <strong>Recognizers</strong>
            class.
        </p>
        <p>
            This sample enumerates the <strong>Recognizers </strong>installed on the current
            system and allows the user to choose between them. An <strong>InkOverlay </strong>
            is attached to a <strong>Panel </strong>for ink collection. After inking some text,
            a "Recognize" menu item triggers text recognition. The best guess or "top string"
            is placed in a <strong>ListBox</strong> and then all the alternates are placed in
            the <strong>ListBox </strong>as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user can additionally erase the ink.
