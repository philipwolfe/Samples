            Speech Recognition</h1>
        This sample demonstrates the capabilities of the Speech API, which comes standard
        with Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005. Although SAPI is less programmed
        for than other APIs, it's extremely rich and similar enough to the handwriting recognition
        APIs that it can be easily learned by those programming Microsoft Windows XP Tablet
        PC Edition 2005.<br />
        <br />
        You must create an Interop wrapper for the SAPI DLL. This can be done by using the
        "Add Reference..." capability, selecting the COM tab, and selecting the "Microsoft
        Speech Object Library." Once that's done, and the <strong>SpeechLib </strong>namespace
        is imported, things are quite similar to programming handwriting recognition using
        the Tablet PC Platform SDK. A recognizer is created (in this case, an in-process
        <strong>SpInProcRecognizer</strong>) and generates a context (type <strong>SpInProcRecoContext</strong>)
        that is associated with the particular recognition. Events associated with the recognition
        process are the <strong>Hypothesis</strong>, <strong>Recognition</strong>, and <strong>
            EndStream </strong>events. A large number of <strong>Hypothesis </strong>events
        will be generated while only one <strong>Recognition </strong>and <strong>EndStream</strong>
        events will be associated with a particular recognition attempt.
        <br />
        <br />
        The sample provides a standard file dialog to open a user-supplied .WAV file. Recognition
        occurs against this file, with the results placed in a <strong>RichTextEdit</strong>
        box. The technique for iterating over alternative possibilities is also shown, although
        that output is directed to the Debug console.
        <br />
        <br />
        This sample requires:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
            <li>Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 </li>
        </ul>
