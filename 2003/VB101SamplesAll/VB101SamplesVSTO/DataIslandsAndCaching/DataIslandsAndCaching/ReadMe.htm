    <h1>Data Islands and Caching</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft Office 2003 provides a powerful data caching ability using a feature called
        data islands.&nbsp; This allows you to store arbitrary serializable data with your
        document.&nbsp; This can be accessed by your customization the next time it is run,
        or by a server in a back-end scenario.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will see a method of filling a dataset, in this case using the Product table in Adventure Works, then storing the data in the document behind
        the scenes.&nbsp; When the document initializes each time, it first attempts to
        read the data from the database directly.&nbsp; If the database cannot be reached,
        most likely due to an off-network scenario, the data is retrieved from the data
        island, if available.&nbsp; A status message in the worksheet indicates the source
        of the data, and whether or not it was found cached (even if it was loaded live).&nbsp;
        The dataset is cached declaratively using the attribute, <em>Cached</em>.&nbsp;
        A second cached field is cached imperatively using the <em>StartCaching </em>method
        which takes the name of an instance variable.&nbsp; The ability to store network-accessed
        information for offline use without resorting to custom persistence is a powerful
        features enabling a more productive, mobile workforce.</p>
