    <h1>Working with Charts in Excel</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft Excel offers a powerful data presentation and manipulation platform for
        tabular data in many formats.&nbsp; In addition to the traditional row/column spreadsheet
        metaphor, you can also create dynamic charts to better visualize data trends.&nbsp;
        As with other Excel objects, you can programmatically interact with charts in various
        ways.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sample, you will see two styles of charts -- a chart object embedded within
        a worksheet, and a chart sheet host item.&nbsp; A chart sheet host item is analogous
        to a worksheet, but contains only a chart, and no cells.&nbsp; In Visual Studio
        Tools for Office, chart sheets have
        their own designer and code-behind. &nbsp; A
        chart object, on the other hand, is treated like any other control.&nbsp; Data is
        bound to columns A-D from the Adventure Works vSalesPersonSalesByFiscalYears view.&nbsp;
        The data is used as the source data for the two charts.&nbsp; The Document Actions
        pane is used to demonstrate programatically setting the chart's caption, the chart
        type, and filtering a dataset bound to a ListObject to affect rendered chart data.&nbsp;
        Note that four of the chart types, with names beginning with xlStock, require specific
        data arrangement in order to work, so will be ignored if selected.&nbsp; Also notice
        that both the chart object and chart sheet are both able to be manipulated identically
        using the customization.&nbsp; Entering a value in the "Show sales consistently
        above" field acts as a filter only showing rows where all values from 2002-2004
        are above that target.</p>
