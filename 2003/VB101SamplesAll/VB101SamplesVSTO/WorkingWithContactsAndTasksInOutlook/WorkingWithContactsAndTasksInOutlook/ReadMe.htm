    <p>
        Outlook is a powerful tool for managing email, contacts, tasks,
        and more.&nbsp; Each item type offers a powerful programming model for interaction making it easy to integrate custom logic with pre-built functionality.&nbsp; Contacts support a
        wealth of person-related information, while tasks allow you to define actions that need to be taken.&nbsp; Both support a number of meta fields including due date,
        subject, reminders, and more.</p>

    <p>
        In this sample, you will create a menu command to enter messages to call people
        back.&nbsp;
        A ComboBox will present the list of contacts from the default Contacts
        folder, along with a button to create a new contact.&nbsp; The large, multi-line
        TextBox provides an area to enter a message, and a MaskedTextBox allows a callback
        date to be entered.&nbsp; All of these fields are presented in a custom Windows
        form.&nbsp; When the Save button is
        clicked, a new Task item is created with a reference
        to the specified contact, along with the optional message body and due date.&nbsp;
        Discover some of the available Outlook events and the proper methods of creating
        and interacting with Outlook items.</p>
