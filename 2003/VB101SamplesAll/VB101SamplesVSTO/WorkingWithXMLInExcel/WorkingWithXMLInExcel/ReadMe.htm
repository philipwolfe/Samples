        Working with XML in Excel</h1>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual Studio Tools for Office 2005 makes it easy to work with XML in Excel. One
        way is to import an XML file via the <strong>Data | Microsoft Office Excel Data | XML |
        XML Source </strong>menu command (path given from within Visual Studio 2005 when viewing
        a Workbook or Worksheet). This allows you to create an XML Map, from which you can
        drag and drop nodes onto a worksheet, mapping the nodes to cells. Another way is
        to create an XML data source, such as a Web service, which returns XML data. This is the
        approach taken by this sample. In both scenarios, mapping an XML node—whether from
        an XML Map or a Web Service Data Source—to a cell creates one or more ListObject
        controls which are bound to those nodes. You can then set the ListObject control's
        DataSource property and the XML data is automatically displayed at runtime.</p>

    <p>
        In this sample you will see how to consume a real-world Web service (Internet connection
        required) in order to display a list of movie times for a selected theater. This
        sample also shows you how to create an Actions Pane control which allows the user to enter a zip code and search radius, to click a
        button to find theaters within
        that search radius, and then to select one or more theaters returned by the Web
        service in order to view the movies, which are databound to the ListObject control
        on a worksheet.</p>

        <b>This sample requires the following to be installed: </b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual Studio 2005</li><li>Microsoft Excel 2003</li></ul>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> You will also need a connection to the Internet.</p>
