    <h1>Membership</h1>

    <p>This sample Web site shows how to use the new membership controls in ASP.NET 2.0, which are: Login,
    LoginStatus, LoginName, LoginView, CreateUserWizard, ChangePassword, and PasswordRecovery.</p>
    
    <p>The sample is set up with Forms authentication to restrict access to the pages found in the
    Members directory; therefore, to get access to the members-only pages, you must create a new
    user and then login with that user account. Once logged in, other options are made available
    to you, such as viewing the secure page and changing your password.</p>
    
    <p>This sample requires the following to be installed:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
            <li>SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</li>
        </ul>
