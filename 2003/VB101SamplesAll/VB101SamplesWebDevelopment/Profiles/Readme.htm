    <h1>Profiles</h1>

    <p>This sample demonstrates how to use profiles in ASP.NET 2.0. Profiles can be used to easily add
    personalization to your web sites, for both anonymous and logged in users.</p>
    
    <p>The first example shows how to create simple profile properties and use them as an 
    anonymous user. The second example shows how to use more complex profile properties, such as
    a collection and a user-defined object. In the final example you see how to migrate the
    profile properties from your anonymous user token to your logged in (authenticated) username.</p>
    
    <p>This sample requires the following to be installed:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
            <li>SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</li>
        </ul>
