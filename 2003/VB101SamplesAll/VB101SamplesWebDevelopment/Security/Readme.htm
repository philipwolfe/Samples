    <h1>Security</h1>

    <p>This sample demonstrates how to programmatically use methods from the new Membership API
    in ASP.NET 2.0 to manage users and their roles.</p>
    
    <p>The sample consists of a Web site with secure and unsecure areas. The only built-in security control that is the 
the Login control. The goal was to show how to do various tasks using the Membership and Roles APIs.</p>
    
    <p>This sample comes with four roles: Administrator, Contractor, Employee and Manager. Each
    role has its own folder within the site for protected pages, and each folder has its own web.config
    file to enforce restricted access to those pages. View the respective web.config files to see which roles 
have access to which folders.</p>
          
    <p>This sample requires the following to be installed:
		<ul>
            <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
            <li>SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</li>
        </ul>
