        <h1>TreeView</h1>

        <p>This sample demonstrates how to use the TreeView control in ASP.NET 2.0. The TreeView
        control is designed to present you with data in a hierarchical structure, where each node
        in the tree can be optionally collapsed and expanded (the default). The control has rich
        design-time features and is ideal for displaying XML data.</p>
        
        <p>There are three examples in this sample. The first example demonstrates how to dynamically
        add nodes to the TreeView control at runtime. The second example shows how to use the TreeView
        control for site navigation by binding it to the new SiteMapDataSource control. The third
        example shows how to respond to a node click event when a node in the tree is selected.</p>
        
        <p>This sample requires the following to be installed:</p>
			<ul>
                <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2005</li>
            </ul>
