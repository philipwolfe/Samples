        Creating a Master-Details View</h1>
    This sample demonstrates three ways to create a master-details view. A master-details
    view is a common user interface paradigm in which two sets of data are displayed.
    A master-details relationship (also known as a parent-child relationship) exists
    between these two sets of data, and it is sometimes desirable to display only those
    details data records that are related to the selected master record.
    <br>
    <br>
    Three tabs are presented. All data is drawn from the AdventureWorks database. The
    first tab presents a master-details view created entirely at design time, using
    the Data Source Explorer. Department data are masters, and Employees in the Departments
    are details.
    <br>
    <br>
    The second tab is divided into two sections. The first section displays Department data, with a BindingNavigator control
    for navigating through the records. The second section displays a DataGridView control of
    Employees in the displayed Department. DataSet DataRelations are used to manage filtering the DataGridView data.
    <br>
    <br>
    The third tab displays a form identical in functionality to that on the second tab,
    but the DataGridView control data is filtered in event handlers, rather than using the data relations.
