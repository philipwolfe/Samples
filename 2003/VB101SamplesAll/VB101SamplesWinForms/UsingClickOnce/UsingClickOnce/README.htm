        <h1>Using ClickOnce</h1>
        ClickOnce is a new deployment technology introduced in the .NET Framework 2.0.
        ClickOnce supports three deployment strategies:
        <ul>
            <li>Check for updates automatically on startup</li>
            <li>Check for updates automatically after startup</li>
            <li>Check for upgrades through application logic</li>
        </ul>
        The first two strategies are configured using Visual Studio 2005, as part of 
        ClickOnce publishing.  The third strategy involves adding code to the application
        to check for updates via a user interface element such as an Update Now button, 
        or automatically by some custom logic.
        <br><br>
        This sample demonstrates implementing ClickOnce updates through application logic,
        in this case, a user interface that allows the user to check for and commence updates.
        <br><br>
        <b>Important Note:</b> This sample cannot be run in Visual Studio 2005.  It must be deployed using ClickOnce, 
        and run from the installed application.  ClickOnce has been configured in this sample 
        to install the application to a local Web site, <a href="http://localhost/UsingClickOnce">http://localhost/UsingClickOnce</a>.  
        To create this Web site and deploy the application , in Visual Studio 2005 select the 
        <b>Build | Publish UsingClickOnce</b> menu command. This will launch the <b>Publish Wizard</b>.
        Accept the default values, and click <b>Finish</b> to deploy the sample application.
        ClickOnce will open a browser to the deployment Web page for the application.  Click
        <b>Install</b> to install the application. If a security warning dialog appears, click <b>Install</b>. 
        ClickOnce will launch the application once it is installed.
        <br><br>
        To generate an update for the application, exit the application and re-publish it using the same procedure. 
        There is no need to make any changes to the application to create an update.  Once an update has been published, do not reinstall
        from the deployment Web page. Instead, navigate to <b>Start | All Programs | Visual Studio 2005 101 Samples | Using ClickOnce</b> to 
        use the application to update itself.
        <br><br>
			This sample requires the following to be installed:	
				<ul>
				<li>Visual Studio 2005</li>
				<li>Internet Information Services</li>
