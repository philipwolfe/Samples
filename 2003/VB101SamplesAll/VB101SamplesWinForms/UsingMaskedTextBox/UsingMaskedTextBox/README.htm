        Using the MaskedTextBox</h1>
    This sample demonstrates user input masking using the MaskedTextBox. The MaskedTextBox
    is a new .NET Framework Windows Forms control similar to the MaskedEdit control
    of Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0.
    <br>
    <br>
    This sample consists of two tabs. The first tab presents a series of MaskedTextBox
    controls to demonstrate masking, type validation, custom mask violation event handlers,
    and ValidatingType type validation failure event handlers. The masks are shown
    in the adjacent labels. For information on the mask codes see

    The second tab provides an interactve form for testing custom masks, and has two
    controls. The first is used for entering the mask to test. The second is a MaskedTextBox
    control that uses this value as its mask.
