If the file doesn't already exist, a new file is created. SafePad.exe can be invoked without a command-line parameter, in which case the README.txt file is opened for editing.</p><p>The 'Special' menu in SafePad can be used to turn on various reliability features within the application. These options can be checked and unchecked in almost any combination, with different results. </p><p>The 'Special' menu also has two commands that will intentionally either hang or crash the application. Note that the crash command is disabled until the application has been open for at least 60 seconds, as several parts of the reliability infrastructure are enabled only after a delay to avoid endless start-fail-restart loops.</p><p>If error reporting is enabled, be sure to check the SafePad entries in the local Error Reporting panel in the Control Panel.  </p><p><b>Note</b>  Individual error reports do not become visible on the winqual.microsoft.com site until 2-4 days have elapsed, due to propagation delays.</p><p>If an error report is submitted, you can go to <a href="https://winqual.microsoft.com/">https://winqual.microsoft.com</a> and login as user 'sdkuser', with the password 'Admin98!' to check on the crash information. Once you've logged-in, visit the 'Software' tab and examine the various statistics for the application.</p></div><UscDataIsland></UscDataIsland></div></div></body></html>
