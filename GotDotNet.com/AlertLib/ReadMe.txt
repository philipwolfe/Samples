AlertLib (Alert Library) is a utility with advanced features.
All alerts from all sites (areas for SPS) are implemented as library items,
folders correspond to sites (areas). If you delete an item from "AlertLib" library,
the alert is automatically deleted from corresponding site (this is not true for 
the trial version). You can filter, sort alerts, do multiple delete in 
Datasheet view..., etc. (almost all operation as in usual SharePoint library).

English version.
For WSS and SPS.

Trial version limitations: 
When you delete an alert item from Alert Library, this doesn't delete the alert from
 corresponding site.
