    WEB SERVICE : BombermanWS Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this BombermanWS project for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your BombermanWS application.

BombermanWS.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

BombermanWS.cpp
    This is the main web source file.

BombermanWS.h
    This header file contains the declarations of the Web Service.

AssemblyInfo.cpp
	Contains custom attributes for modifying assembly metadata.


BombermanWS.vsdisco
    This is the discovery file for your web service.
    Web Service discovery is the process of locating and interrogating Web Service descriptions, 
    which is a preliminary step for accessing a Web Service. It is through the discovery process 
    that Web Service clients learn that a Web Service exists, what its capabilities are, and 
    how to properly interact with it. 
    Programmatic discovery can be enabled when a Web Service publishes a .disco file, which is 
    an XML document that contains links to other resources that describe the Web Service. 

Web.Config
    This file allows you to override the default configuration settings for your service. 
    Web Services use the configuration file to allow customization and extensibility of the system. 
    You might supply a Web Service specific Web.Config file, for instance, if your Web Service 
    requires authentication and other Web Applications on the system do not.
