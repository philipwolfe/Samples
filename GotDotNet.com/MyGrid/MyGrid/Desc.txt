grd Version 1.0

Hi there,

   This is my first control and not yet finished because I need suggestions.
This grid supports combobox,datetimepicker,noneditable columns,some other extra functionality and good looking interface (I did not yet make good but I think not very bad.)

   I'm trying now add a design-time form designer.But I've got some problems.When I add the designer property the grid couldn't be drag and drop over the container.

   Try this in the grd.vb file

<Designer(GetType(MyGridDesigner)), DesignTimeVisible(True), ToolboxBitmap(GetType(grd), "grd.ico")> _
Public Class grd
    Inherits System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid

And also it is a problem that to list a class (here is grd class) members within the PropertyGrid control.

I hope I'll make these on the other version.

Please send your suggestions and bugs(I did not yet test well for bugs).
