		<b>ResGenX</b> will process any existing txt resource files and files in the 
		extended format that is defined by this project. An extended format txt file 
		look like the following:
		<pre>
SymbolicName:MessageID = message text
</pre>
		In the extended format the <b>message text</b> can consist of multiple lines, 
		i.e.
		<pre>
SymbolicName:MessageID = message text line1
                         message text line2
                         message text line3
                         
</pre>
		The message is terminated by a blank line. The <b>SymbolicName</b> is optional 
		in both single and multi line mode.
		<p>
			To support the <b>SymbolicName</b> option a new command line option is 
			available:<br>
			<span style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">/xref {cs|vb}</span><br>
			This option specifies the type of <b>SymbolicName, MessageID</b> cross 
			reference class to create. Specify <b>cs</b> for CSharp style and <b>vb</b> for 
			Visual Basic. If this option is omitted and symbolic names are used then both 
			types are created.
		</p>
		<b>ResGenX</b> also supports using <b>.mc</b> files as input. To use a <b>.mc</b>
		file it must adhere to the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				SeverityNames and FacilityNames have the following format:
				<pre>
	 SeverityName = (label=value:name ... )
	 FacilityNames = (label=value:name ... )
	 </pre>
				The <b>:name</b> element is ignored. The following Severity codes are 
				predefined:<pre>
	 Success = 0x0
	 Informational = 0x1
	 Warning = 0x2
	 Error = 0x3
	 </pre>
				The following Facility names codes are predefined:<pre>
	 System = 0xFF
	 Application = 0xFFF
	 </pre>
			<li>
				The LanguageNames directive has the following format:
				<p>
				LanguageNames = (language=culturename ... )
				<p>
					For example: LanguageNames=(English=en German=de)<br>
					The following Languages are predefined:</p>
				<pre>
		English   en
		German    de
		TChinese  zv-CHT    (Chinese Traditional)
		SChinese  zv-CHS    (Chinese Simplified) 
		Spanish   es
		French    fr
	 </pre>
			<li>
				Message text contains Managed Code formatting strings not printf strings. The <b>McToMMc</b>
				program will convert the formating strings in a .mc file to those usable with <b>ResGenX</b>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			A message is defined by the following structure:<pre>
		 MessageId = [number|+number]
		 Severity = severity_name
		 Facility = facility_name
		 SymbolicName = name
		 OutputBase = {number}
		
		 following by: (for each language)
		 Language=name
		 message text
		 .
		</pre>
			<b>OutputBase</b> is ignored. <b>Message text</b>
		may be single or multi lined and is terminated by a line that contains only a 
		period or a blank line.
		<P></P>
		A resource file is created for each language and the format of the file name is <i>
			mcfilename.culture.resources(.resx)</i>. Also the message text of the first 
		language for a message is used to create the <b>fallback</b> resource file. 
		This file is named <i>mcfilename.resources(.resx)</i> .
		<p>The <b>/xref</b> command line option also applies to <b>.mc</b> file 
			processing and has the same meaning as in <b>.txt</b> file processing. Both 
			.txt and .mc files support the following text formating strings:
			<ul>
				<li>
				\n - for newline
				<li>
				\t - for tag
				<li>
				\b - for a leading or trailing space
				<li>
					\0 - if at the end of the last line, do not insert a newline at the end of a 
					message</li>
			</ul>
		<P>For both <b>.mc</b> and <b>.txt</b> files a newline charcter is appended to 
			the end of the last line of a message. The <b>\0</b> formating string supresses 
			this behavior.</P>
