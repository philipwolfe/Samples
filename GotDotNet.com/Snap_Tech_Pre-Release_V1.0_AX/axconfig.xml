	<!--InstallCode parameter determines which snaps would get installed. To install more than one snap, you need to add 
	their values. The codes for the Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0 snaps are: Customer Journal = 1, Custom Report Generator = 2, 
	Timesheet Management = 16, Vacation Management = 32, Business Data Lookup = 64. So if you want to install Customer Journal
	and Business Data Lookup, you should set the InstallCode to 1 + 64 = 65-->
	<InstallCode>65</InstallCode>
	<!-- InstalDir is the absolute location where the snaps are going to be installed-->
