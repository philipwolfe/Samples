	<!--InstallCode parameter determines which snaps would get installed. To install more than one snap, you need to add 
	their values. The codes for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 snaps are: Customer Journal = 1, Custom Report Generator = 2,
	Business Data Lookup = 64. So if you want to install Customer Journal and Business Data Lookup, you should set the InstallCode
	to 1 + 64 = 65-->
	<InstallCode>64</InstallCode>
