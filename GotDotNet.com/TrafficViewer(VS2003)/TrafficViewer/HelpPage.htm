				Overview:&nbsp; Trafficviewer is a consolidated list of nearly all available 
				traffic camera images in Washington State.&nbsp; The&nbsp;camera images are 
				stored in different lists, by State Route, County, and by city.&nbsp; Since 
				Washington State DOT has the most cameras, they are displayed by default, when 
				the program loads.&nbsp;
			</P>
			<P>&nbsp; Washington State is divided into 4 quadrants, NW, NE, SW, and SE.&nbsp; 
				These are selectable by clicking on the small Washington map thumbnail image at 
				the top of the main form.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</P>
			<P>&nbsp; The State Route and City labels are displayed in a box on the top right 
				corner.&nbsp; These can be clicked on to select a specific route.&nbsp; As a SR 
				Label is selected, the&nbsp;camera list located below the SR Labels 
				box&nbsp;displays all available camera images for the selected route, or the 
				selected city or county.&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly all of the&nbsp;files that this program uses are 
				embedded in the executable.&nbsp; Seperate Files that are not embedded, and 
				registry keys that are created and used by this program are as follows:</P>
			<P>&nbsp; One registry sub key is created whenever an update version is 
				downloaded.&nbsp; The subkey stores the current location of TrafficViewer.exe, 
				so that the new executable can easily be installed to this location.&nbsp; This 
				subkey is deleted the first time that the new executable runs, or if the update 
				is cancelled while downloading.&nbsp; Temporary registry sub key location 
				is:&nbsp;</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registry sub key: 
				HKeyLocalMachine\Software\TrafficViewer\</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StringValue Stored 
				in&nbsp;subkey:&nbsp; (Directory path of current TrafficViewer program)</P>
			<P>&nbsp; An application folder is also created in:&nbsp; C:\Documents and 
				Settings\UserName\Application Data\TrafficViewer\</P>
			<P>Permanent Files used:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Settings.dat file, to store the 
				selectable color of the State route labels.</P>
			<P>Temp Files used:&nbsp; The Updater, and new Exe files are stored in a temp 
				folder when downloading, and the temp folder, and all its contents&nbsp;are 
				deleted when the new executable runs.&nbsp;</P>
