						<h3>XPath XPress Help</h3>
						<h4>Summary</h4>
						XPath XPress is an Xpath expression evaluation tool written in the 
						Microsoft.NET framework.
						<h4>Getting Started</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Load an XML document you wish to evaluate expressions against by clicking on 
								the 'open' button in the toolbar. A treeview representation of the document is 
								displayed on the form.</li>
							<li>
								Set the context node for evaluating the expression against by clicking on one 
								of the nodes in the tree. If you do not select a node the root node of the 
								document will be used. The context node is highlighted when you evaluate an 
								expression.</li>
							<li>
								Type your expression in the text box at the top of the form. XPath XPress can 
								evaluate the expression as you type it, or only when you click the 'Test' 
								button. You can set this behaviour in the preferences dialog which is displayed 
								when you click the preferences button in the toolbar.</li>
							<li>
								Matching nodes are hilighted in the document tree. The number of matches is 
								displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the form. Also, you can move to 
								any of the matching nodes at any time by selecting them from the drop-down list 
								in the toolbar.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>Preferences</h4>
						The following properties can be set in the preferences dialog.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Context Node Color: The color that is used to hilight the context node in the 
								document tree view.</li>
							<li>
								Match Node Color: The color that is used to hilight nodes that match your 
								expression.</li>
							<li>
								Evaluate Expressions Interactively: Set the way expressions are evaluated, 
								either as you type them, or when you click the test button.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						XPath Xpress uses the the DotNetWidgets controls developed by <a href="http://windowsforms.net/Default.aspx?tabindex=5&tabid=47">
							windows forms code hero</a> Tim Dawson. They are available from his site <a href="http://www.divil.co.uk/net/">
