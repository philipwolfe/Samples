With a multimon setup its a pain when you need to move a
window from one monitor to the next - especially maximized
windows. With this utility, simply hit the hotkey and the
active window jumps to the next monitor.

Currently the HotKey is hardcoded as Ctrl-Enter.


JumpWin v1.6 - Monitor switching utility for application windows.
	Usage: JumpWin [-alt] [-ctrl]
		Arguments:
		
		-alt:Make the key combinations ALT+Enter and SHIFT+ALT+Enter
		-ctrl:Make the key combinations CTRL+Enter and SHIFT+CTRL+Enter;

By default the key combination WIN+Enter moves the current active window
to the next monitor.  The restore position of the window will be scaled to
be proportionate to the size on the previous monitor.  If the window is
maximized, it will be maximized on the new monitor as well.  To disable
the scaling, add the SHIFT key to your key combination (e.g.
SHIFT+WIN+Enter), as some applications do not handle resizing of their
windows well.

Version 1.6:	Modified the maximized window behavior.
		Formerly it first hide the target window, then moved
		it to the next monitor. This reduced the amount of
		redrawing onscreen. Unfortunatly, it had the bad habit
		of screwing up Excel - Excel would loose its menus.
		Now, it no longer does the hide.
		
		The auto-resize window feature now tests to see if the
		window is resizable first.
		
		Prevents multiple copies of itself from running.
