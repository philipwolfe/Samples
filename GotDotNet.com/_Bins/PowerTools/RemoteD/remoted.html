            RemoteD is lightweight utility that lets you to interact with two or more
            networked computers with a single mouse and keyboard.  It works like a
            software switchbox, enabling you to switch the mouse and keyboard input
            to another computer by simply moving the mouse pointer off the screen.
            
            <p>
            Scenarios:
            <ul>
              <li>Use it to switch between development and test computers.</li>
              <li>Use it to control multiple computers in a lab environment.</li>
              <li>Use it to control a laptop from the comfort of your main computer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <p>
            <em>RemoteD is </em>not<em> a utility that allows remote viewing of a
            desktop, such as Terminal Server, XP's Remote Desktop Sharing, or VNC.</em>

            <h3>Installation:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Copy <tt>rdclient.exe</tt> to your main computer.  You can put it anywhere.</li>
              <li>Copy <tt>rdserver.exe</tt> to your peripheral computer(s).  You can put it anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Now run RDServer on the peripheral machine.  You will be prompted with a
            configuration dialog, most fields are optional:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p><b>Password</b></p>
            
            <p>
            The password is used as the key to encrypt data sent over the network.  Do not use
            any of your regular passwords.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Save Password</b></p>
            
            <p>
            Check this option to save the password so that you do not have to enter it
            every time you launch the program.  <em>Note: The saved password obscured, but
            as with all applications there is no way to prevent a determined person with
            access to the machine from viewing it.</em>
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Require NTLM Authentication</b></p>
            
            <p>
            Check this option to force clients to authenticate using their NT
            credentials.  The authentication process is separate from the
            encryption Password.  NTLM Authentication is optional but
            recommended when it can be used.  Both machines must be a member of
            the same domain and support NTLM Authentication (i.e. NT, Win2k, and XP).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>ACL</b></p>
            
            <p>
            ACL stands for Access Control List.  It is an optional semicolon
            separated list of DNS names for clients that are allowed to connect
            to the RemoteD server.  If this field is filled in any computer not on
            the list will be prevented from connecting.  <em>Note: See the rdserver.log
            file to identify the exact DNS name of the client.</em>
            </p>

            <p><b>rdserver.log</b></p>

            <p>
            RDServer keeps an activity/security log in
            <tt>rdserver.log</tt>, which is written to the current working
            directory (usually the same directory that rdserver.exe is in).
            </p>
                  
            </blockquote>

            <p>
            After configuring RDServer run RDClient on your main computer.
            Using the tray icon choose "RemoteD Client Options".  In this dialog
            you must enter the same password that you entered in RDServer.  Use
            Add, Modify, and Remove to configure the set of peripheral computers and
            the side of the screen they are chained on.  <b>The NTLM Authentication
            option must match with the peripheral machine's configuration</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
            After both computers are configured you can connect and
            disconnect by selecting the computer name in the RDClient tray
            icon's popup menu.  When you select a server there may be a few
            second delay while the connection is negotiated.

                Troubleshooting steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Verify that NTLM Authentication option for the peripheral
                    computer you are trying to connect to is correct.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    If the computers are running Win9X/ME, or they are not on
                    the same domain, you will need to disable the NLTM
                    Authentication option.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    If you are using firewall software, including XP's Internet
                    Connection Firewall, you will need to configure it to allow
                    activity on port 1692.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>
                    If you have set the Access Control List on RDServer use the
                    rdserver.log file to verify that the DNS name is correct.
                    If it still doesn't work try temporarily clearing the ACL
                    textbox.
                  </li>

                  <li>If the machine was recently reconnected to the network
                    the DNS lookup to get the IP address may fail.  You can wait a
                    few minutes or try to connect using the IP address.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

             <ul>
              <li><h4>Another application window steals focus</h4>
                <p>
                This is the most common problem, and it's usually just an
                occasional annoyance.  When an application or system-modal
                dialog on the main computer forces itself to get focus the mouse
                will jump back to the main computer.  The workaround is to move
                the mouse pointer back to the main computer, dismiss the
                dialog if there was one, and move the mouse pointer back to the
                other computer.
                </p>

                <p>
                Another manifestation of this problem is that when you
                type the system will beep.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li><h4>Stuck on remote desktop</h4>
                <p>
                In extremely rare circumstances you may find that you're stuck on the peripheral
                computer and you cannot move the mouse back.  If this happens to hit
                the 'Windows' key to move back to the main computer.  If that fails
                you may need to use Ctrl-Alt-Delete and kill the <tt>rdclient.exe</tt>
                process.
                </p>
              </li>

            <em>Note: When the mouse is on the peripheral computer you will see a 1-pixel
            dot that is used to identify the mouse on the main machine.</em>
