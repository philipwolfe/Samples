Known issues:
  Works best with verbose setup logs.  Non-verbose do not provide enough information to be very helpful when determining any setup errors.  To turn on verbose logging you can pass /l*v on the commandline to msiexec.  Example:
msiexcec /i myapp.msi /l*v c:\mylog.log

  Can't currently customize the ignored errors, being considered in future release

  Context help missing as well as help file, being consided in future release.  Right now, readme.txt is it.
