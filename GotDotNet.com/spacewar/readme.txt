SpaceWar

SpaceWar was one of the first, if not *the* first video game ever 
created, written on a DEC PDP 1 at MIT. By the standards of the day,
it was an incredible achievement. By the standards of today, it has
very primitive graphics, but the gameplay is still good.

I first read about SpaceWar in an article (web link) in Creative
Computing magazine (long since gone) in 1984 (check date).
