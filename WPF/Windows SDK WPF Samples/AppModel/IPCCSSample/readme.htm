Instead, a new instance of a page is created each time it is navigated to. Subsequently, any state information on the first instance of the page is not remembered when the page is navigated to again. It is possible for WPF to retain page instances and, implicitly, page state in navigation history, although this can be costly from a memory consumption perspective.</p><p>However, WPF provides an infrastructure that allows you to both store state information with a page entry in navigation history and reapply it to the new page instance when navigated to using navigation history.</p><p>This sample shows how a page can implement <b>IProvideCustomContentState</b> to allow it to remember a single set of state, which may contain one or more items. When a page is navigated away from, WPF calls GetContentState to ask the page for state that it wants to be remembered. <b>GetContentState</b> returns an subclass of <b>CustomContentState</b>, which you create to store and replay state.</p><p>This technique is most useful when you need to store several items of page state across page instances. To remember a single item of state across page instances, you should consider using a journalable dependency property (see <a href="f7f63c9a-dc15-4a80-a11f-a5ee38664e3e.htm">Remember A Single Item of State Across Page Instances</a>). To remember multiple sets of state for a single page instance, see <a href="36acb52b-f432-468f-9d4e-6a25d90b4de3.htm">Remember Multiple Sets of State Per Page Instance</a>.</p><div class="alert"><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><th align="left">Important: </th></tr><tr><td><p> When you store information in custom content state, you cannot store any references to the instance of the page for which you are remembering state. This prevents WPF from releasing the page instance, and defeats the purpose of the default navigation history behavior. If you must do this, you might consider using KeepAlive instead.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><UscDataIsland></UscDataIsland></div></div></body></html>
