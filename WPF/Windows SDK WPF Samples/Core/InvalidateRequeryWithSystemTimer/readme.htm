Another way to solve this problem, and in most cases a better and more elegant way, is a use the DispatcherTimer.  This is easier because the <b>DispatcherTimer</b> runs on the same thread as the UI Thread.  For information, see the <a href="94016925-a168-4f9d-bb36-838066cdd803.htm">Disable Command Source Via Dispatcher Timer Sample</a>  sample.  There are times though when you may need to use a class that doesn't run on the UI thread, so this sample shows how to accomplish this.</p><p>Command sources, such as the MenuItem class and the Button class, listen to the CanExecuteChanged event on the RoutedCommand they are attached to in order to determine when they need to query the command to see if the command can execute on the current command target.  Command sources will typically disable themselves if the command cannot execute and enable themselves if the command can execute, such as when a <b>MenuItem</b> gray's itself out when the command cannot execute.</p><p>The CommandManager notifies the <b>RoutedCommand</b> via the RequerySuggested event that conditions have changed with the command target.  The <b>RoutedCommand</b> raises the <b>CanExecuteChanged</b> event which the command source listens to.  Normally, this notification mechanism is adequate, but there are some situations where the <b>CommandManager</b> is unaware that the conditions have changed on the command target and thus the <b>RequerySuggested</b> event is never raised and the command source never queries the <b>RoutedCommand</b>.  In these situations the <b>CommandManager</b> can be forced to raise the <b>RequerySuggested</b> event by calling InvalidateRequerySuggested.</p><p>This sample creates a <b>RoutedCommand</b> that can be executed only when the seconds in the current time are greater than a target value.  A a System.Windows.Timers.Timer is created that pushes a job on the Dispatcher of the UI thread every second.  Since this job is scheduled on the <b>Dispatcher</b> of the UI thread, the UI thread will update the UI for us.  </p><p>The method that is pushed onto the <b>Dispatcher</b> calls <b>InvalidateRequerySuggested</b>.  This insures that the command source will receive the <b>CanExecuteChanged</b> event so that it can call the CanExecute method on the command.</p><p>For more information on commanding see the Commanding Overview.</p><p>This sample demonstrates a specific feature of the Windows Presentation Foundation and, consequently, does not follow application development best practices.
