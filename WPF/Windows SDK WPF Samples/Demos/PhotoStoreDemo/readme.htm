The user interface (UI) takes advantage of many styling techniques in order to create a visually attractive and interesting UI.

Photos and products in the demonstration application are not actually for sale.</p><p>Keyboard commands are supported in the application for navigation purposes. The arrow keys can be used to select a photo. The tab key supports navigation to and from the various portions of the UI.</p><p>In order to crop a portion of an image, simply drag the mouse over a portion of the image while holding down the left mouse button. This will draw a yellow border around the selected portion of the image (the intended crop region). The Crop button will then be available to you.</p></div><h1 class="heading">See Also</h1><div id="seeAlsoSection" class="seeAlsoNoToggleSection"><h4 class="subHeading">Reference</h4>System.Windows.Media.Imaging<br />BitmapImage<br />DataTemplate<br />DoubleAnimation<br />ControlTemplate<br /><h4 class="subHeading">Other Resources</h4>Animation Overview<br /><br /></div><UscDataIsland></UscDataIsland></div></div></body></html>
