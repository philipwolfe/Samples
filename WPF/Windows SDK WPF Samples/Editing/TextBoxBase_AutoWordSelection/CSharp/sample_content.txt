Fable: The Lost Chapters

Based on the best-selling award-winning Xbox title Fable, Fable: The Lost Chapters 
is now fully optimized for the Windows platform complete with expanded content, 
greater customization, new quests and enhanced graphics. In this groundbreaking 
role-playing adventure game from Lionhead Studios, your every action determines 
your character’s skills, appearance and morality. Your character’s life story is
created from childhood through to adulthood and on to old age. Grow from an 
inexperienced child into the most powerful being in the world, spoken of by all 
and immortalized in legend. As additional story and side quests await, choose 
the path of righteousness, or dedicate your life to evil, and see yourself 
transform into a reflection of your actions and decisions. Age leaves you wizened 
and battle leaves you scarred as you explore the world of Albion and the plethora 
of expanded and enhanced content.

With experience comes advancement and physical change, whether it be expanding 
muscles, a keen eye and nimble form, or the buzz of magical energies around your 
finger tips. As you develop your alter ego, the world reacts to you and your actions. 
People comment on your successes and failures, your appearance, and your 
behavior. Fable: The Lost Chapters offers Windows gamers even more character 
customization choices that will impact your appearance. The denizens of Albion’s 
many opinions are expressed through applause, mockery, trepidation, panic, and 
even flirtation if they feel so inclined. Each person you aid, each flower you
crush, each creature you slay, will change this world forever. In Fable: The 
Lost Chapters, gamers decide: “Who will I be?”
