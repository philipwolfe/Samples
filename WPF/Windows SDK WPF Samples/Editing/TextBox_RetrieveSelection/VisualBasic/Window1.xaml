    <TextBox Name="tbSelectSomeText" TextWrapping="Wrap"  xml:space="preserve">Recently, a handful of lucky journalists and Microsoft insiders got some trigger time with Halo(R) 2. The event took place deep within Bungie-occupied territory, where a once-stodgy meeting room had been converted into a gamer's paradise. Fourteen Xbox(R) video game systems, earth-shaking speaker systems, flat panel TVs, Xbox Live(TM) headsets, and plush chairs awaited the chosen few. For the rest of the, we found ourselves firmly planted in front of our screens, enjoying a first encounter with what may be the most anticipated game on any console to date. Enter a beautiful, combat-filled Halo 2. The fortunate crew included folks from 1UP, GamePro, Games Domain, GameSpot, GameSpy, IGN, MSN, TeamXbox and yours truly from Xbox.com. The event was hosted by Bungie's Community Guy Brian Jarrard and Bungie.net Editor Frank O'Connor. Jarrard and O'Connor took time out from their busy schedules not only to talk to us about Halo 2, but also to play with us and demonstrate some of the new game types and maps. (By "demonstrate," I mean, of course, "repeatedly shooting us in the head, while chatting about the new features." These guys are good.)
      
The Bungie lads were quick to point out that the user interface (U.I.) is in the process of getting a makeover, but it was already obvious it will be efficient and gorgeous. Online play via Xbox Live-and we were playing on Xbox Live, not some kind of high-speed corporate network-was very smooth. The weapons all seemed balanced and useful. We were told that final optimizations to networking and gameplay are still being made, but from our comfy chairs, things already look fantastic.</TextBox>
