        This example shows a DropShadowBitmapEffect applied to a Button. A DropShadowBitmapEffect
        applies a shadow behind a visual object at a slight offset. The offset is determined by
        mimicking a casting shadow from an imaginary light source.

            <!-- The DropShadowBitMapEffect has several important properties that
             determine characteristics of the drop shadow: 
             - Color: Specifies the color of the drop shadow (in this example black).
             - ShadowDepth: Specifies how far displaced the shadow is from the object
               casting the shadow. Default is 20.
             - Direction: Specifies in what direction the shadow is cast from the object. 
               It is an angle between 0 and 360 with 0 starting on the right hand side 
               and moving counter-clockwise around the object. The value of 320 in this 
               example casts the shadow on the lower right hand side of the button.
             - Noise: Specifies how grainy the drop-shadow is. Range is between 0 and 1.
               Default is 0.
             - Softness: Specifies how soft the shadow. The range is between 0 and 1 with 1
               being the softest. Default is 0.5. 
             - Opacity: Specifies how transparent the shadow is. The range is between 0 
               and 1 with 1 being fully opaque and 0 fully transparent (not visible). The
               default is 1. -->
