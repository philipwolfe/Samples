Several samples depend on IIS.  To set up IIS, follow the One-Time Set Up
Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples for WCF 3.5.  This
is located on the MSDN Library pages for the WCF 3.5 samples.  Use the 
setupvroot.cmd included in this directory instead of the ones located in the
3.5 WCF/WF samples download.
